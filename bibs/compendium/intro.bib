abstract = {Although cell division is usually portrayed as an equitable process by which a progenitor cell originates two identical daughter cells, there are multiple examples of asymmetric divisions that generate two cells that differ in their content, morphology and/or proliferative potential. The capacity of the cells to generate asymmetry during their division is of paramount biological relevance, playing essential roles during embryonic development, cellular regeneration and tissue morphogenesis. Problems with the proper establishment of asymmetry and polarity during cell division can give rise to cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as to also accelerate cellular aging. Interestingly, the microtubule organizing centers that orchestrate the formation of the mitotic spindle have been described among the cellular structures that can be differentially allocated during asymmetric cell divisions. This mini-review focuses on recent research from our group and others uncovering a role for the non-random distribution of the spindle-associated microtubule organizing centers in the differential distribution of aging factors during asymmetric mitoses and therefore in the maintenance of the replicative lifespan of the cells.},

abstract = {A female-sterile zebrafish maternal-effect mutation in cellular atoll (cea) results in defects in the initiation of cell division starting at the second cell division cycle. This phenomenon is caused by defects in centrosome duplication, which in turn affect the formation of a bipolar spindle. We show that cea encodes the centriolar coiled-coil protein Sas-6, and that zebrafish Cea/Sas-6 protein localizes to centrosomes. cea also has a genetic paternal contribution, which when mutated results in an arrested first cell division followed by normal cleavage. Our data supports the idea that, in zebrafish, paternally inherited centrosomes are required for the first cell division while maternally derived factors are required for centrosomal duplication and cell divisions in subsequent cell cycles. DNA synthesis ensues in the absence of centrosome duplication, and the one-cycle delay in the first cell division caused by cea mutant sperm leads to whole genome duplication. We discuss the potential implications of these findings with regards to the origin of polyploidization in animal species. In addition, the uncoupling of developmental time and cell division count caused by the cea mutation suggests the presence of a time window, normally corresponding to the first two cell cycles, which is permissive for germ plasm recruitment. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The spindle apparatus segregates bi-oriented sister chromatids during mitosis but mono-oriented homologous chromosomes during meiosis I. It has remained unclear if similar molecular mechanisms operate to regulate spindle dynamics during mitosis and meiosis I. Here, we employed live-cell microscopy to compare the spindle dynamics of mitosis and meiosis I in fission yeast cells and demonstrated that the conserved kinesin-14 motor Klp2 plays a specific role in maintaining metaphase spindle length during meiosis I but not during mitosis. Moreover, the maintenance of metaphase spindle stability during meiosis I requires the synergism between Klp2 and the conserved microtubule cross-linker Ase1, as the absence of both proteins causes exacerbated defects in metaphase spindle stability. The synergism is not necessary for regulating mitotic spindle dynamics. Hence, our work reveals a new molecular mechanism underlying meiotic spindle dynamics and provides insights into understanding differential regulation of meiotic and mitotic events.},

abstract = {We identified a truncated allele of dam1 as a multicopy suppressor of the sensitivity of cdc13-117 (cyclin B) and mal3-1 (EB-1) cells to thiabendazole, a microtubule poison. We find that Dam1 binds to the plus end of spindle microtubules and kinetochores as cells enter mitosis and this is dependent on other components of the fission yeast DASH complex, including Ask1, Duo1, Spc34 and Dad1. By contrast, Dad1 remains bound to kinetochores throughout the cell cycle and its association is dependent on the Mis6 and Mal2, but not Mis12, Nuf2 or Cnp1, kinetochore proteins. In cells lacking Dam1, or other components of the DASH complex, anaphase is delayed due to activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint and lagging sister chromatids are frequently observed and occasionally sister chromatid pairs segregate to the same spindle pole. We find that the mitotic centromere-associated Klp5/Klp6 kinesin complex is essential in cells lacking components of the DASH complex. Cells lacking both Dam1 and Klp5 undergo a first cell cycle arrest in mitosis due to a failure to establish bipolar chromosome attachment. {\textcopyright} 2005 European Molecular Biology Organization | All Rights Reserved.},

We report here that Ran-GTP stimulates the interaction between TPX2 and the Xenopus Aurora A kinase, Eg2. This interaction causes TPX2 to stimulate both the phosphorylation and the kinase activity of Eg2 in a microtubule-dependent manner. We show that TPX2 and microtubules promote phosphorylation of Eg2 by preventing phosphatase I (PPI)-induced dephosphorylation. Activation of Eg2 by TPX2 and microtubules is inhibited by importin-$\alpha$ and -$\beta$, although this inhibition is overcome by Ran-GTP both in the egg extracts and in vitro with purified proteins. As the phosphorylation of Eg2 stimulated by the Ran-GTP-TPX2 pathway is essential for spindle assembly, we hypothesize that the Ran-GTP gradient established by the condensed chromosomes is translated into the Aurora A kinase gradient on the microtubules to regulate spindle assembly and dynamics.},

We first provide a background regarding the basic principles of this program. We then summarize current understanding of the DNA events of recombination and of three processes that involve whole chromosomes: homolog pairing, crossover interference, and chiasma maturation. All of these processes are implemented by direct physical interaction of recombination complexes with underlying chromosome structures.

abstract = {The centrosome acts as the major microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) for cytoskeleton maintenance in interphase and mitotic spindle assembly in vertebrate cells. It duplicates only once per cell cycle in a highly spatiotemporally regulated manner. When the cell undergoes mitosis, the duplicated centrosomes separate to define spindle poles and monitor the assembly of the bipolar mitotic spindle for accurate chromosome separation and the maintenance of genomic stability. However, centrosome abnormalities occur frequently and often lead to monopolar or multipolar spindle formation, which results in chromosome instability and possibly tumorigenesis. A number of studies have begun to dissect the role of mitotic kinases, including NIMA-related kinases (Neks), cyclindependent kinases (CDKs), Polo-like kinases (Plks) and Aurora kinases, in regulating centrosome duplication, separation and maturation and subsequent mitotic spindle assembly during cell cycle progression. In this Commentary, we review the recent research progress on how these mitotic kinases are coordinated to couple the centrosome cycle with the cell cycle, thus ensuring bipolar mitotic spindle fidelity. Understanding this process will help to delineate the relationship between centrosomal abnormalities and spindle defects.},

abstract = {Pairing of homologous chromosomes is important for homologous recombination and correct chromosome segregation during meiosis. It has been proposed that telomere clustering, nuclear oscillation, and recombination during meiotic prophase facilitate homologous chromosome pairing in fission yeast. Here we examined the contributions of these chromosomal events to homologous chromosome pairing, by directly observing the dynamics of chromosomal loci in living cells of fission yeast. Homologous loci exhibited a dynamic process of association and dissociation during the time course of meiotic prophase. Lack of nuclear oscillation reduced association frequency for both centromeric and arm regions of the chromosome. Lack of telomere clustering or recombination reduced association frequency at arm regions, but not significantly at centromeric regions. Our results indicate that homologous chromosomes are spatially aligned by oscillation of telomere-bundled chromosomes and physically linked by recombination at chromosome arm regions; this recombination is not required for association of homologous centromeres. {\textcopyright} 2004 by Cell Press.},

The conserved linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex connects fission yeast centromeres and the centrosome, across the NE, during interphase. During meiosis, LINC connects the centrosome with telomeres rather than centromeres. We previously showed that loss of telomere-LINC contacts compromises meiotic spindle formation. Here, we define the precise events regulated by telomere-LINC contacts and address the analogous possibility that centromeres regulate mitotic spindle formation. We develop conditionally inactivated LINC complexes in which the conserved SUN-domain protein Sad1 remains stable but severs interphase centromere-LINC contacts. Strikingly, the loss of such contacts abolishes spindle formation. We pinpoint the defect to a failure in the partial NE breakdown required for centrosome insertion into the NE, a step analogous to mammalian NE breakdown. Thus, interphase chromosome-LINC contacts constitute a cell-cycle control device linking nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic events.},

How k-fibers mature from initial kinetochore microtubule attachments remains a fundamental question. By combining molecular perturbations and phenotypic analyses in Indian muntjac fibroblasts containing the lowest known diploid chromosome number in mammals (2N = 6) and distinctively large kinetochores, with fixed/live-cell super-resolution coherent-hybrid stimulated emission depletion (CH-STED) nanoscopy and laser microsurgery, we demonstrate a key role for augmin in kinetochore microtubule self-organization and maturation, regardless of pioneer centrosomal microtubules. In doing so, augmin promotes kinetochore and interpolar microtubule turnover and poleward flux. Tracking of microtubule growth events within individual k-fibers reveals a wide angular dispersion, consistent with augmin-mediated branched microtubule nucleation. Augmin depletion reduces the frequency of kinetochore microtubule growth events and hampers efficient repair after acute k-fiber injury by laser microsurgery. Together, these findings underscore the contribution of augmin-mediated microtubule amplification for k-fiber self-organization and maturation in mammals.},

abstract = {The organization and number of microtubules (MTs) in a cell depend on the proper regulation of MT nucleation. Currently, the mechanism of nucleation is the most poorly understood aspect of MT dynamics. XMAP215/chTOG/Alp14/Stu2 proteins are MT polymerases that stimulate MT polymerization at MT plus ends by binding and releasing tubulin dimers. Although these proteins also localize to MT organizing centers and have nucleating activity in vitro, it is not yet clear whether these proteins participate in MT nucleation in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the XMAP215 ortholog Alp14 is critical for efficient MT nucleation in vivo. In multiple assays, loss of Alp14 function led to reduced nucleation rate and numbers of interphase MT bundles. Conversely, activation of Alp14 led to increased nucleation frequency. Alp14 associated with Mto1 and $\gamma$-tubulin complex components, and artificially targeting Alp14 to the $\gamma$-tubulin ring complexes ($\gamma$-TuRCs) stimulated nucleation. In imaging individual nucleation events, we found that Alp14 transiently associated with a $\gamma$-tubulin particle shortly before the appearance of a new MT. The transforming acidic coiled-coil (TACC) ortholog Alp7 mediated the localization of Alp14 at nucleation sites but not plus ends, and was required for efficient nucleation but not for MT polymerization. Our findings provide the strongest evidence to date that Alp14 serves as a critical MT nucleation factor in vivo. We suggest a model in which Alp14 associates with the $\gamma$-tubulin complex in an Alp7-dependent manner to facilitate the assembly or stabilization of the nascent MT. Microtubules are dynamic polymers that help to organize cellular contents and divide the cell. New microtubules arise by a process of nucleation, in which tubulin subunits are stitched together to begin forming a hollow tube. Flor-Parra et al. identify XMAP215/Alp14 as a nucleation factor that facilitates the assembly of the microtubule.},

abstract = {The cycle of spindle pole body (SPB) duplication, differentiation, and segregation in Schizosaccharomyces pombe is different from that in some other yeasts. Like the centrosome of vertebrate cells, the SPB of S. pombe spends most of interphase in the cytoplasm, immediately next to the nuclear envelope. Some $\gamma$-tubulin is localized on the SPB, suggesting that it plays a role in the organization of interphase microtubules (MTs), and serial sections demonstrate that some interphase MTs end on or very near to the SPB. $\gamma$-Tubulin is also found on osmiophilic material that lies near the inner surface of the nuclear envelope, immediately adjacent to the SPB, even though there are no MTs in the interphase nucleus. Apparently, the MT initiation activities of $\gamma$-tubulin in S. pombe are regulated. The SPB duplicates in the cytoplasm during late G2 phase, and the two resulting structures are connected by a darkly staining bridge until the mitotic spindle forms. As the cell enters mitosis, the nuclear envelope invaginates beside the SPB, forming a pocket of cytoplasm that accumulates dark amorphous material. The nuclear envelope then opens to form a fenestra, and the duplicated SPB settles into it. Each part of the SPB initiates intranuclear MTs, and then the two structures separate to lie in distinct fenestrae as a bipolar spindle forms. Through metaphase, the SPBs remain in their fenestrae, bound to the polar ends of spindle MTs; at about this time, a small bundle of cytoplasmic MTs forms in association with each SPB. These MTs are situated with one end near to, but not on, the SPBs, and they project into the cytoplasm at an orientation that is oblique to the spindle axis. As anaphase proceeds, the nuclear fenestrae close, and the SPBs are extruded back into the cytoplasm. These observations define new fields of enquiry about the control of SPB duplication and the dynamics of the nuclear envelope.},

abstract = {During mitosis, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) inhibits the Cdc20-activated anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/CCdc20), which promotes protein degradation, and delays anaphase onset to ensure accurate chromosome segregation. However, the SAC function in meiotic anaphase regulation is poorly understood. Here, we examined the SAC function in fission yeast meiosis. As in mitosis, a SAC factor, Mad2, delayed anaphase onset via Slp1 (fission yeast Cdc20) when chromosomes attach to the spindle improperly. However, when the SAC delayed anaphase I, the interval between meiosis I and II shortened. Furthermore, anaphase onset was advanced and the SAC effect was reduced at meiosis II. The advancement of anaphase onset depended on a meiosis-specific, Cdc20-related factor, Fzr1/Mfr1, which contributed to anaphase cyclin decline and anaphase onset and was inefficiently inhibited by the SAC. Our findings show that impacts of SAC activation are not confined to a single division at meiosis due to meiosis-specific APC/C regulation, which has probably been evolved for execution of two meiotic divisions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Yamamoto et al.},

The first few divisions during mouse development occur without centrioles, which form around embryonic day (E) 3. However, disruption of centriole biogenesis in Sas-4 null mice leads to embryonic arrest around E9. Centriole loss in Sas 4-/- embryos causes prolonged mitosis and p53-dependent cell death. Studies in vitro discovered a similar USP28-, 53BP1-, and p53-dependent mitotic surveillance pathway that leads to cell cycle arrest. In this study, we show that an analogous pathway is conserved in vivo where 53BP1 and USP28 are upstream of p53 in Sas-4-/- embryos. The data indicates that the pathway is established around E7 of development, four days after the centrioles appear. Our data suggest that the newly formed centrioles gradually mature to participate in mitosis and cilia formation around the beginning of gastrulation, coinciding with the activation of mitotic surveillance pathway upon centriole loss.},

abstract = {In this brief account we specifically address the question of how the plasma membrane-associated basal body/axoneme of the unicellular ancestor of eukaryotes has evolved into the centrosome organelle through the several attempts to multicellularity. We propose that the connection between the flagellar apparatus and the nucleus has been a critical feature for leading to the centriole-based centrosome of metazoa, the Spindle Pole Body of fungi, or to the absence of any centrosome in seed plants. We further suggest that the evolution of this connection could be reflected in the evolution of the centrin proteins. We then review evidence showing that the evolution of the centrosome-based tubulin network has been correlated with the evolution of the cortical actin-based cleavage apparatus. Finally we argue that this coevolution had a major impact on the cell individuation process and on the evolution of multicellular organisms. We conclude that only the metazoan lineage evolved multicellularity without loosing the ancestral association of three basic cellular functions of the basal body/ axoneme or the derived centrosome organelle, namely sensation, motion and division. {\textcopyright} 2007 Landes Bioscience and Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Insertion of a cluster of recruiting motifs into a chromosome lacking its endogenous pairing centre is sufficient to restore homologous pairing, synapsis, crossover recombination and segregation.

abstract = {Examination of factors regulating oocyte chromatin remodeling is crucial to circumvent embryonic aneuploidy and resulting defects. Aurora kinases (AURK) are involved in regulation of chromatin remodeling, however, little attention has been paid to AURKs in regard to oocyte maturation. Meiotically incompetent mouse oocytes contain transcripts for all three Aurk isoforms: A, B and C. Upon achieving meiotic competence, oocytes showed significant increases in transcript levels of all three Aurk isoforms and transcript levels remained unchanged as oocytes progressed through meiosis, with AurkA being the predominant isoform. Inhibition of oocyte AURKs during the prophase-metaphase I (MI) transition via inhibitor ZM447439 (ZM) had no effect on germinal vesicle breakdown. However, meiotic spindles were malformed, and microtubule organizing centers and chromatin were scattered. Chromosomal spreads of MI oocytes indicated AURK inhibition resulted in abnormal chromosome condensation. Furthermore, inhibition of AURK during prophase I-MII prevented completion of MII and extrusion of the polar body. Inhibition of AURKs during the MI-MII transition resulted in significantly fewer cells progressing to MII and induced aberrant chromatin remodeling. Further analysis indicated that inhibition of AURKs resulted in absence of histone-H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 and 28. These data suggest a ZM-sensitive AURK may be an oocyte histone-H3 kinase capable of regulating chromatin remodeling throughout oocyte meiosis, both pre- and post-MI. {\textcopyright} The Author 2008.

abstract = {The assembly of a bipolar spindle lies at the heart of mitotic chromosome segregation. In animal somatic cells, the process of spindle assembly involves multiple complex interactions between various cellular compartments, including an emerging antiparallel microtubule network, microtubule-associated motor proteins and spindle assembly factors, the cell's cortex, and the chromosomes themselves. The result is a dynamic structure capable of aligning pairs of sister chromatids, sensing chromosome misalignment, and generating force to segregate the replicated genome into two daughters. Because the centrosome lies at the center of the array of microtubule minus-ends, and the essential one-to-two duplication of the centrosome prior to mitosis is linked to cell cycle progression, this organelle has long been implicated as a device to generate spindle bipolarity. However, this classic model for spindle assembly is challenged by observations and experimental manipulations demonstrating that acentrosomal cells can and do form bipolar spindles, both mitotic and meiotic. Indeed, recent comprehensive proteomic analysis of centrosome-dependent versus independent mitotic spindle assembly mechanisms reveals a large, common set of genes required for both processes, with very few genes needed to differentiate between the two. While these studies cast doubt on an absolute role for the centrosome in establishing spindle polarity, it is clear that having too few or too many centrosomes results in abnormal chromosome segregation and aneuploidy. Here we review the case both for and against the role of the centrioles and centrosomes in ensuring proper assembly of a bipolar spindle, an essential element in the maintenance of genomic stability.},

Despite this knowledge, molecular mechanisms by which this complex contributes to establishment of correct bipolar attachment of the kinetochore to the spindle microtubule remain largely elusive [1, 2, 4, 5]. Here we show that the conserved internal loop [6, 7] of fission yeast Ndc80 directly binds the Dis1/TOG microtubule-associated protein [8-10], thereby coupling spindle microtubule dynamics with kinetochore capture. Ndc80 loop mutant proteins fail to recruit Dis1 to kinetochores, imposing unstable attachment and frequent spindle collapse. In these mutants, mitotic progression is halted attributable to spindle assembly checkpoint activation, and chromosomes remain in the vicinity of the spindle poles without congression. dis1 deletion precisely phenocopies the loop mutants. Intriguingly, forced targeting of Dis1 to the Ndc80 complex rescues loop mutant's defects. We propose that Ndc80 comprises two microtubule-interacting interfaces: the N-terminal region directly binds the microtubule lattice, while the internal loop interacts with the plus end of microtubules via Dis1/TOG. Therefore, our results provide a crucial insight into how the Ndc80 complex establishes stable bipolar attachment to the spindle microtubule. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Centrosomes also act as the basal body of cilia, regulating cilium length and affecting extracellular signal reception as well as the integration of intracellular signalling pathways. Centrosomes are self-replicative and duplicate once every cell cycle to generate two centrosomes. The core support structure of the centrosome consists of two molecularly distinct centrioles. The mother (mature) centriole exhibits accessory appendages and is surrounded by both pericentriolar material and centriolar satellites, structures that the daughter (immature) centriole lacks. In this Review, we discuss what is currently known about centrosome duplication, its dialogue with the cell cycle and the sequential acquisition of specific components during centriole maturation. We also describe our current understanding of the mature centriolar structures that are required to build a cilium. Altogether, the built-in centrosome asymmetries that stem from the two centrosomes inheriting molecularly different centrioles sets the foundation for cell division being an intrinsically asymmetric process.},

abstract = {In fission yeast and other eukaryotes, Rec12 (Spo11) is thought to catalyze the formation of dsDNA breaks (DSBs) that initiate homologous recombination in meiosis. Rec12 is orthologous to the catalytic subunit of topoisomerase VI (Top6A). Guided by the crystal structure of Top6A, we engineered the rec12 locus to encode Rec12 proteins each with a single amino acid substitution in a conserved residue. Of 21 substitutions, 10 significantly reduced or abolished meiotic DSBs, gene conversion, crossover recombination and the faithful segregation of chromosomes. Critical residues map within the metal ion-binding pocket toprim (E179A, D229A, D231A), catalytic region 5Y-CAP (R94A, D95A, Y98F) and the DNA-binding interface (K201A, G202E, R209A, K242A). A subset of substitutions reduced DSBs but maintained crossovers, demonstrating crossover homeostasis. Furthermore, a strong separation of function mutation (R304A) suggests that the crossover/non-crossover decision is established early by a protein-protein interaction surface of Rec12. Fission yeast has multiple crossovers per bivalent, and chromosome segregation was robust above a threshold of about one crossover per bivalent, below which non-disjunction occurred. These results support structural and functional conservation among Rec12/Spo11/Top6A family members for the catalysis of DSBs, and they reveal how Rec12 regulates other features of meiotic chromosome dynamics.

However, the requirement of RanGTP in living meiotic cells has not been shown. In this study, we used a fluorescence resonance energy transfer probe to measure RanGTP-regulated release of importin $\beta$. A RanGTP-regulated gradient was established during meiosis I and was centered on chromosomes throughout mouse meiotic maturation. Manipulating levels of RanGTP in mice and X. laevis oocytes did not inhibit assembly of functional meiosis I spindles. However, meiosis II spindle assembly did not tolerate changes in the level of RanGTP in both species.

abstract = {During meiosis, telomeres cluster and promote homologous chromosome pairing. Telomere clustering requires the interaction of telomeres with the nuclear membrane proteins SUN (Sad1/UNC-84) and KASH (Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne homology). The mechanism by which telomeres gather remains elusive. In this paper, we show that telomere clustering in fission yeast depends on microtubules and the microtubule motors, cytoplasmic dynein, and kinesins. Furthermore, the $\gamma$-tubulin complex ($\gamma$-TuC) is recruited to SUN- and KASH-localized telomeres to form a novel microtubule-organizing center that we termed the "telocentrosome." Telocentrosome formation depends on the $\gamma$-TuC regulator Mto1 and on the KASH protein Kms1, and depletion of either Mto1 or Kms1 caused severe telomere clustering defects. In addition, the dynein light chain (DLC) contributes to telocentrosome formation, and simultaneous depletion of DLC and dynein also caused severe clustering defects.

abstract = {An important question in cell biology is how cellular organelles partition during cell division. In organisms undergoing closed mitosis, the elongation of an intranuclear spindle drives nuclear division, generating two identically sized nuclei [1, 2]. However, how the site of nuclear division is determined and the underlying mechanism driving nuclear envelope (NE) fission remain largely unknown. Here, using the fission yeast, we show that the microtubule bundler Ase1/PRC1 at the spindle midzone is required for the local concentration of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) in the region of the NE in contact with the central spindle. As the spindle elongates during anaphase B, components of these NPCs are sequentially eliminated, and this is accompanied by the local remodeling of the NE. These two events lead to the eventual removal of NPCs and nuclear division. In the absence of importin $\alpha$, NPCs remain stable in this region and no event of NE remodeling is observed. Consequently, cells fail to undergo nuclear division. Thus, our results highlight a new role of the central spindle as a spatial cue that determines the site of nuclear division and point to NPC removal as the triggering event.},

abstract = {The effects of oocyte aging on meiotic spindle dynamics have been well recognised, but the mechanisms underlying the effects are not well understood. In this paper we review the role of centrosomes and the microtubule cytoskeleton in meiotic spindle formation and maintenance, and the impact of oocyte aging on spindle integrity resulting in centrosome and microtubule dysfunctions that are associated with aneuploidy. Loss of spindle integrity includes dispersion of proteins from the centrosome core structure and loss of attachment of microtubules to centrosomes and kinetochores, which will result in abnormal chromosome separation. The inability of centrosomal proteins to accurately associate with the centrosome structure may be the result of destabilisation of the core structure itself or of microtubule destabilisation at the centrosome-facing microtubule areas that are acetylated in fresh oocytes but may not be acetylated in aging oocytes. Microtubule destabilisation prevents accurate motor-driven transport of centrosomal proteins along microtubules to form and maintain a functional centrosome. Other factors to form and maintain the MII spindle include signal transductions that affect microtubule dynamics and stability. Understanding the mechanisms underlying centrosome and microtubule dysfunctions during oocyte aging will allow diagnosis and analysis of oocyte quality and abnormalities as important aspects for targeted treatment of aging oocytes to extend or restore viability and developmental capacity. New therapeutic approaches will allow improvements in reproductive success rates in IVF clinics, as well as improvements in reproductive success rates in farm animals. This review is focused on: (1) centrosome and microtubule dynamics in fresh and aging oocytes; (2) regulation of centrosome and/or microtubule dynamics and function; and (3) possible treatments to extend the oocyte's reproductive capacity and viability span.},

abstract = {The general features and fine structure of homologous chromosome alignment and pairing have been investigated in two species of Allium (A. fistulosum and A. cepa), which have similar karyotypes but very different patterns of chiasma distribution. Although there is no support for the occurrence of a general pre-meiotic alignment of homologous chromosomes, both species show some alignment of homologues as an immediate prelude to synaptonemal complex (SC) formation. In both species pairing usually commences at sub-terminal sites and is succeeded by numerous separate intercalary initiations of pairing in interstitial and distal regions and then in proximal regions. The last parts to pair, in both species, are pericentromeric and telomeric regions. There is, therefore, no evident relationship between the sequence of pairing and chiasma distribution in these species. Regularly alternating convergences and divergences of aligned axial cores (ACs), termed multiple association sites, are frequently observed. It is proposed that these represent potential pairing initiation sites and from observations on their spatial distribution it is argued that they may be evenly distributed through most of the genome. Small spherical or ellipsoid nodules are found at association sites and between closely aligned ACs which persist in the SC segments present during zygotene, but most of them disappear abruptly at the end of zygotene. These are termed zygotene nodules (ZN) and it is proposed that they are involved in matching corresponding sites on homologous chromosomes as well as possibly having a recombinational role. Their composition, structure, mode of action and relationship to pachytene recombination nodules are at present unknown. {\textcopyright} 1987 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Assembly of the meiotic spindles during progesterone-induced maturation of Xenopus oocytes was examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy using anti-tubulin antibodies and by time-lapse confocal microscopy of living oocytes microinjected with fluorescent tubulin. Assembly of a transient microtubule array from a disk-shaped MTOC was observed soon after germinal vesicle breakdown. This MTOC-TMA complex rapidly migrated toward the animal pole, in association with the condensing meiotic chromosomes. Four common stages were observed during the assembly of both M1 and M2 spindles: (1) formation of a compact aggregate of microtubules and chromosomes; (2) reorganization of this aggregate resulting in formation of a short bipolar spindle; (3) an anaphase-B-like elongation of the prometaphase spindle, transversely oriented with respect to the oocyte A-V axis; and (4) rotation of the spindle into alignment with the oocyte axis. The rate of spindle elongation observed in M1 (0.7 $\mu$m min-1) was slower than that observed in M2 (1.8 $\mu$m min-1). Examination of spindles by immunofluorescence with antitubulin revealed numerous interdigitating microtubules, suggesting that prometaphase elongation of meiotic spindles in Xenopus oocytes results from active sliding of antiparallel microtubules. A substantial number of maturing oocytes formed monopolar microtubule asters during M1, nucleated by hollow spherical MTOCs. These monasters were subsequently observed to develop into bipolar M1 spindles and proceed through meiosis. The results presented define a complex pathway for assembly and rotation of the meiotic spindles during maturation of Xenopus oocytes. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Several mitotic regulators, including Cyclin B1/Cdk1, are present at centrosomes prior to mitosis onset, but it is unclear whether centrosomes promote mitotic entry in vivo. Here we developed a sensitive assay in C. elegans embryos for the temporal analysis of mitotic entry, in which the male and female pronuclei undergo asynchronous entry into mitosis when separated from one another. Using this assay, we found that centrosome integrity is necessary for timing mitotic entry. Centrosomes do not function in this instance through their ability to nucleate microtubules. Instead, centrosomes serve to focus the Aurora A kinase AIR-1, which is essential for timely mitotic entry. Furthermore, analysis of embryos in which centrosomes and pronuclei are detached from one another demonstrates that centrosomes are sufficient to promote mitosis onset. Together, our findings support a model in which centrosomes serve as integrative centers for mitotic regulators and thus trigger mitotic entry in a timely fashion. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we review recent evidence suggesting the preprophase band in plants functions analogously to the centrosome in animals in establishing spindle bipolarity, and we review recent progress characterizing the roles of specific motor proteins in plant mitosis. Loss of function of certain minus-end-directed KIN-14 motor proteins causes a broadening of the spindle pole; whereas, loss of function of a KIN-5 causes the formation of monopolar spindles, resembling those formed when the homologous motor protein (e.g., Eg5) is knocked out in animal cells. We present a phylogeny of the kinesin-5 motor domain, which shows deep divergence among plant sequences, highlighting possibilities for specialization. Finally, we review information concerning the roles of selected structural proteins at mitosis as well as recent findings concerning regulation of M-phase in plants.

abstract = {Chromosome biorientation, the attachment of sister kinetochores to sister spindle poles, is vitally important for accurate chromosome segregation. We have studied this process by following the congression of pole-proximal kinetochores and their subsequent anaphase segregation in fission yeast cells that carry deletions in any or all of this organism's minus end–directed, microtubule-dependent motors: two related kinesin 14s (Pkl1p and Klp2p) and dynein. None of these deletions abolished biorientation, but fewer chromosomes segregated normally without Pkl1p, and to a lesser degree without dynein, than in wild-type cells. In the absence of Pkl1p, which normally localizes to the spindle and its poles, the checkpoint that monitors chromosome biorientation was defective, leading to frequent precocious anaphase. Ultrastructural analysis of mutant mitotic spindles suggests that Pkl1p contributes to error-free biorientation by promoting normal spindle pole organization, whereas dynein helps to anchor a focused bundle of spindle microtubules at the pole.},

Over six meters long in men, ∼80 meters in stallions and over one-hundred times a mouse's body length, there are few functions known aside from sperm storage and nutrition. While spermatogenesis is completed in the testes, here we demonstrate sperm centriole reduction occurs within the epididymis. Investigations of GFP-CENTR mice and controls demonstrate both the presence of centriole pairs in the upper caput region of the epididymis and, the destruction, first, of the distal and, then, of the proximal centriole as the sperm transits to the cauda and vas deferens in preparation for its climactic release. These centrioles can neither recruit $\gamma$-tubulin nor nucleate microtubules when eggs are inseminated or microinjected, yet numerous maternally-nucleated cytasters are found. These sperm centrioles appear as vestigial basal bodies, destroyed in the mid-to-lower corpus. Post-testicular sperm maturation, in which sperm centrioles found in the caput are destroyed prior to ejaculation, is a newly discovered function for the epididymis.},

abstract = {Pairing of homologous chromosomes during early meiosis is essential to prevent the formation of aneuploid gametes. Chromosome pairing includes a step of homology search followed by the stabilization of homolog interactions by the synaptonemal complex (SC). These events coincide with dramatic changes in nuclear organization and rapid chromosome movements that depend on cytoskeletal motors and are mediated by SUN-domain proteins on the nuclear envelope, but how chromosome mobility contributes to the pairing process remains poorly understood. We show that defects in the mitochondria-localizing protein SPD-3 cause a defect in homolog pairing without impairing nuclear reorganization or SC assembly, which results in promiscuous installation of the SC between non-homologous chromosomes. Preventing SC assembly in spd-3 mutants does not improve homolog pairing, demonstrating that SPD-3 is required for homology search at the start of meiosis. Pairing center regions localize to SUN-1 aggregates at meiosis onset in spd-3 mutants; and pairing-promoting proteins, including cytoskeletal motors and polo-like kinase 2, are normally recruited to the nuclear envelope. However, quantitative analysis of SUN-1 aggregate movement in spd-3 mutants demonstrates a clear reduction in mobility, although this defect is not as severe as that seen in sun-1(jf18) mutants, which also show a stronger pairing defect, suggesting a correlation between chromosome-end mobility and the efficiency of pairing. SUN-1 aggregate movement is also impaired following inhibition of mitochondrial respiration or dynein knockdown, suggesting that mitochondrial function is required for motor-driven SUN-1 movement. The reduced chromosome-end mobility of spd-3 mutants impairs coupling of SC assembly to homology recognition and causes a delay in meiotic progression mediated by HORMA-domain protein HTP-1. Our work reveals how chromosome mobility impacts the different early meiotic events that promote homolog pairing and suggests that efficient homology search at the onset of meiosis is largely dependent on motor-driven chromosome movement. {\textcopyright} 2013 Labrador et al.},

A baseline of 20% of human oocytes are estimated to be aneuploid and this increases exponentially from 30 to 35 years, reaching on average 80% by 42 years. As a result, reproductive senescence in human females is predominantly determined by the accelerated decline in genetic quality of oocytes from 30 years of age. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Understanding mechanisms of chromosome segregation and aneuploidies in the female germline is a crucial step towards the development of new diagnostic approaches and, possibly, for the development of therapeutic targets and molecules. Here, we have reviewed emerging mechanisms that may drive human aneuploidy, in particular the maternal age effect. SEARCH METHODS: We conducted a systematic search in PubMed Central of the primary literature from 1990 through 2016 following the PRISMA guidelines, using MeSH terms related to human aneuploidy. For model organism research, we conducted a literature review based on references in human oocytes manuscripts and general reviews related to chromosome segregation in meiosis and mitosis. OUTCOMES: Advances in genomic and imaging technologies are allowing unprecedented insight into chromosome segregation in human oocytes. This includes the identification of a novel chromosome segregation error, termed reverse segregation, as well as sister kinetochore configurations that were not predicted based on murine models. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Elucidation of mechanisms that result in errors in chromosome segregation in meiosis may lead to therapeutic developments that could improve reproductive outcomes by reducing aneuploidy.},

The complex events involved in homolog juxtaposition necessitate prolongation of prophase, thus permitting resolution of events that are temporally compressed in the mitotic cycle. Furthermore, once homologs are paired, the chromosomes are connected by a specific structure: the synaptonemal complex. Finally, interaction of homologs includes recombination at the DNA level, which is intimately linked to structural features of the chromosomes. In consequence, recombination- related events report on diverse aspects of chromosome morphogenesis, notably relationships between sisters, development of axial structure, and variations in chromatin status. The current article reviews recent information on these topics in an historical context. This juxtaposition has suggested new relationships between structure and function.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Meiotic chromosome segregation in human oocytes is notoriously error-prone, especially with ageing. Such errors markedly reduce the reproductive chances of increasing numbers of women embarking on pregnancy later in life. However, understanding the basis for these errors is hampered by limited access to human oocytes. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Important new discoveries have arisen from molecular analyses of human female recombination and aneuploidy along with high-resolution analyses of human oocyte maturation and mouse models. Here, we review these findings to provide a contemporary picture of the key players choreographing chromosome segregation in mammalian oocytes and the cellular basis for errors. SEARCH METHODS: A search of PubMed was conducted using keywords including meiosis, oocytes, recombination, cohesion, cohesin complex, chromosome segregation, kinetochores, spindle, aneuploidy, meiotic cell cycle, spindle assembly checkpoint, anaphasepromoting complex, DNA damage, telomeres, mitochondria, female ageing and female fertility. We extracted papers focusing on mouse and human oocytes that best aligned with the themes of this review and that reported transformative and novel discoveries. OUTCOMES: Meiosis incorporates two sequential rounds of chromosome segregation executed by a spindle whose component microtubules bind chromosomes via kinetochores. Cohesion mediated by the cohesin complex holds chromosomes together and should be resolved at the appropriate time, in a specific step-wise manner and in conjunction with meiotically programmed kinetochore behaviour. In women, the stage is set for meiotic error even before birth when female-specific crossover maturation inefficiency leads to the formation of at-risk recombination patterns. In adult life, multiple co-conspiring factors interact with at-risk crossovers to increase the likelihood of mis-segregation. Available evidence support that these factors include, but are not limited to, cohesion deterioration, uncoordinated sister kinetochore behaviour, erroneous microtubule attachments, spindle instability and structural chromosomal defects that impact centromeres and telomeres. Data from mice indicate that cohesin and centromere-specific histones are long-lived proteins in oocytes. Since these proteins are pivotal for chromosome segregation, but lack any obvious renewal pathway, their deterioration with age provides an appealing explanation for at least some of the problems in older oocytes. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Research in the mouse model has identified a number of candidate genes and pathways that are important for chromosome segregation in this species. However, many of these have not yet been investigated in human oocytes so it is uncertain at this stage to what extent they apply to women. The challenge for the future involves applying emerging knowledge of female meiotic molecular regulation towards improving clinical fertility management.},

abstract = {Centrosome reduction is the decrease in centrosomal components during spermatid differentiation (spermiogenesis) [1, 2]. It is one of several dramatic subcellular reorganizations that lead to spermatozoa formation common to a wide range of animals [3]. However, the mechanism underlying centrosome reduction is unknown and its functions are unclear. Here, we show that in Drosophila melanogaster spermiogenesis, the quantity of centrosomal proteins is dramatically reduced [4, 5]; for example, Asterless (Asl) is reduced ∼500-fold and is barely detected in spermatozoa. Asl reduction is regulated through a subset of its domains by the master regulator of centriole duplication Plk4 [6-8] and by the ubiquitin ligase that targets Plk4 for degradation: Slimb [9, 10]. When Asl reduction is attenuated by Asl overexpression, plk4 mutations, Plk4 RNAi, or Slimb overexpression, Asl levels are higher in spermatozoa, resulting in embryos with reduced viability. Significantly, overexpressing Plk4 and Asl simultaneously, or combining plk4 and slimb mutations, balances their opposing effects on Asl reduction, restoring seemingly normal fertility. This suggests that increased Asl levels cause the observed reduced fertility and not other pleotropic effects. Attenuation of Asl reduction also causes delayed development and a failure to form astral microtubules in the zygote. Together, we provide the first insight into a molecular mechanism that regulates centrosome reduction and the first direct evidence that centrosome reduction is essential for post-fertilization development.},

abstract = {We identify a novel meiotic recombination intermediate, the single-end invasion (SEI), which occurs during the transition from double-strand breaks (DSBs) to double-Holliday junction (dHJs). SEIs are products of strand exchange between one DSB end and its homolog. The structural asymmetry of SEIs indicates that the two ends of a DSB interact with the homolog in temporal succession, via structurally (and thus biochemically) distinct processes. SEIs arise surprisingly late in prophase, concomitant with synaptonemal complex (SC) formation. These and other data imply that SEIs are preceded by nascent DSB-partner intermediates, which then undergo selective differentiation into crossover and noncrossover types, with SC formation and strand exchange as downstream consequences. Late occurrence of strand exchange provides opportunity to reverse recombinational fate even after homologs are coaligned and/or synapsed. This feature can explain crossover suppression between homeologous and structurally heterozygous chromosomes.},

abstract = {Gene conversion is a common outcome of double-strand break (DSB) repair in yeast. Prior studies revealed that DSB-induced gene conversion tracts are often short (<53 bp), unidirectional, and biased toward promoter-proximal (5′) markers. In those studies, broken ends had short, non-homologous termini. For the present study we created plasmid × chromosome, chromosomal direct repeat and allelic recombination substrates in which donor alleles carried mutant HO sites (HOinc-not cleaved) at the same position as cleavable HO sites in recipient alleles. In these substrates, broken ends are almost completely homologous to donor alleles, differing only at the three HOinc mutations. These mutations serve as markers very close to, or within, the four-base overhang produced by HO nuclease. We identified extremely short tracts (<12 bp) and many tracts were highly directional, extending <2 bp on one side of the DSB. We thought that terminal homology would promote bidirectional tracts, but found instead that unidirectional tracts were more frequent. Interestingly, substrates with terminal homology displayed enhanced 3′ conversion, and in several cases conversion bias was reversed toward 3′ markers. These results are discussed in relation to factors that may influence tract length and directionality, including heteroduplex: DNA formation, transcription, replication and mismatch repair.},

abstract = {Microtubule organization in bovine oocytes during fertilization, polyspermy, parthenogenesis, and nuclear transfer is examined with the goal of understanding microtubule activity and the manner in which the centrosome during fertilization and mitotic spindle poles are established. In the unfertilized bovine oocyte, microtubules are detected only in the metaphase-arrested second meiotic spindle; no cytoplasmic asters are observed. After insemination, a small aster of microtubules is seen adjacent to the incorporated sperm head. This aster enlarges and, at the time of pronuclear apposition, fills the cytoplasm. At prophase, the aster splits and forms the poles for the first mitotic spindle, which is anastral, fusiform, and often located eccentrically. During anaphase, asters assemble at each spindle pole. After telophase, these asters develop into the interphase array of microtubules in the daughter blastomeres. During polyspermy, an aster forms from a site between each incorporated sperm head and tail. Multiple mitotic spindles are observed in polyspermic zygotes; multipolar spindles are not seen. Parthenogenetic activation with 5 $\mu$m ionomycin followed by a 4-hr incubation in 1.9 mM dimethylaminopurine results in > 80% activation, and antitubulin immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrates that initially disarrayed microtubules are observed and the same microtubules extend from the remnants of the second meiotic spindle. At the time normal for cell division, these parthenogenotes form anastral, barrel-shaped bipolar mitotic spindles. Asters form at the spindle poles at anaphase and the parthenogenotes divide from one to two blastomeres. Nuclear fusion of a morula-derived blastomere to a parthenogenetically activated oocyte results in either a single microtubule aster or at times, two asters, formed in association with the donated nucleus. These results demonstrate that fertilization in the cow is a blending of paternally and maternally derived centrosomal material. {\textcopyright} 1994 by Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae meiosis, recombination occurs frequently between sequences at the same location on homologs (allelic recombination) and can take place between dispersed homologous sequences (ectopic recombination). Ectopic recombination occurs less often than does allelic, especially when homologous sequences are on heterologous chromosomes. To account for this, it has been suggested that homolog pairing (homolog colocalization and alignment) either promotes allelic recombination or restricts ectopic recombination. The latter suggestion was tested by examining ectopic recombination in two cases where normal interhomolog relationships are disrupted. In the first case, one member of a homolog pair was replaced by a homoeologous (related but not identical) chromosome that has diverged sufficiently to prevent allelic recombination. In the second case, ndj1 mutants were used to delay homolog pairing and synapsis. Both circumstances resulted in a substantial increase in the frequency of ectopic recombination between arg4-containing plasmid inserts located on heterologous chromosomes. These findings suggest that, during normal yeast meiosis, progressive homolog colocalization, alignment, synapsis, and allelic recombination restrict the ability of ectopically located sequences to find each other and recombine. In the absence of such restrictions, the meiotic homology search may encompass the entire genome.},

Centrosomal abnormalities result in inaccurate microtubule organization and inaccurate chromosome alignment, with failures in chromosome segregation leading to aneuploidy and chromosomal abnormalities.

abstract = {Meiotic recombination requires pairing of homologous chromosomes, the mechanisms of which remain largely unknown. When pairing occurs during meiotic prophase in fission yeast, the nucleus oscillates between the cell poles driven by astral microtubules. During these oscillations, the telomeres are clustered at the spindle pole body (SPB), located at the leading edge of the moving nucleus and the rest of each chromosome dangles behind. Here, we show that the oscillatory nuclear movement of meiotic prophase is dependent on cytoplasmic dynein. We have cloned the gene encoding a cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain of fission yeast. Most of the cells disrupted for the gene show no gross defect during mitosis and complete meiosis to form four viable spores, but they lack the nuclear movements of meiotic prophase. Thus, the dynein heavy chain is required for these oscillatory movements. Consistent with its essential role in such nuclear movement, dynein heavy chain tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) is localized at astral microtubules and the SPB during the movements. In dynein-disrupted cells, meiotic recombination is significantly reduced, indicating that the dynein function is also required for efficient meiotic recombination. In accordance with the reduced recombination, which leads to reduced crossing over, chromosome missegregation is increased in the mutant. Moreover, both the formation of a single cluster of centromeres and the colocalization of homologous regions on a pair of homologous chromosomes are significantly inhibited in the mutant. These results strongly suggest that the dynein-driven nuclear movements of meiotic prophase are necessary for efficient pairing of homologous chromosomes in fission yeast, which in turn promotes efficient meiotic recombination.},

abstract = {Background: Inducible inactivation of a protein is a powerful approach for analysis of its function within cells. Fission yeast is a useful model for studying the fundamental mechanisms such as chromosome maintenance and cell cycle. However, previously published strategies for protein-depletion are successful only for some proteins in some specific conditions and still do not achieve efficient depletion to cause acute phenotypes such as immediate cell cycle arrest. The aim of this work was to construct a useful and powerful protein-depletion system in Shizosaccaromyces pombe.Results: We constructed an auxin-inducible degron (AID) system, which utilizes auxin-dependent poly-ubiquitination of Aux/IAA proteins by SCFTIR1in plants, in fission yeast. Although expression of a plant F-box protein, TIR1, decreased Mcm4-aid, a component of the MCM complex essential for DNA replication tagged with Aux/IAA peptide, depletion did not result in an evident growth defect. We successfully improved degradation efficiency of Mcm4-aid by fusion of TIR1 with fission yeast Skp1, a conserved F-box-interacting component of SCF (improved-AID system; i-AID), and the cells showed severe defect in growth. The i-AID system induced degradation of Mcm4-aid in the chromatin-bound MCM complex as well as those in soluble fractions. The i-AID system in conjunction with transcription repression (off-AID system), we achieved more efficient depletion of other proteins including Pol1 and Cdc45, causing early S phase arrest.Conclusion: Improvement of the AID system allowed us to construct conditional null mutants of S. pombe. We propose that the off-AID system is the powerful method for in vivo protein-depletion in fission yeast. {\textcopyright} 2011 Kanke et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {The yeast spindle pole body (SPB) is the functional equivalent of the mammalian centrosome. Centrosomes and SPBs duplicate exactly once per cell cycle by mechanisms that use the mother structure as a platform for the assembly of the daughter. The conserved Sfi1 and centrin proteins are essential components of the SPB duplication process. Sfi1 is an elongated molecule that has, in its center, 20 to 23 binding sites for the Ca(2+)-binding protein centrin. In the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, all Sfi1 N termini are in contact with the mother SPB whereas the free C termini are distal to it. During S phase and early mitosis, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) phosphorylation of mainly serine residues in the Sfi1 C termini blocks the initiation of SPB duplication ("off" state). Upon anaphase onset, the phosphatase Cdc14 dephosphorylates Sfi1 ("on" state) to promote antiparallel and shifted incorporation of cytoplasmic Sfi1 molecules into the half-bridge layer, which thereby elongates into the bridge. The Sfi1 C termini of the two Sfi1 layers localize in the bridge center, whereas the N termini of the newly assembled Sfi1 molecules are distal to the mother SPB. These free Sfi1 N termini then assemble the new SPB in G1phase. Recruitment of Sfi1 molecules into the anaphase SPB and bridge formation were also observed inSchizosaccharomyces pombe, suggesting that the Sfi1 bridge cycle is conserved between the two organisms. Thus, restricting SPB duplication to one event per cell cycle requires only an oscillation between Cdk1 kinase and Cdc14 phosphatase activities. This clockwork regulates the "on"/"off" state of the Sfi1-centrin receiver.},

A shared feature of RPMs is that the force that drives the chromosomal movements is transmitted from the cytoskeleton, through the nuclear envelope, to the telomeres. Studies in mice suggested that dynein movement along microtubules is transmitted to telomeres through SUN1/KASH5 nuclear envelope bridges to generate RPMs. We monitored RPMs in mouse seminiferous tubules using 4D fluorescence imaging and quantitative motion analysis to characterize patterns of movement in the RPM process. We find that RPMs reflect a combination of nuclear rotation and individual chromosome movements. The telomeres move along microtubule tracks that are apparently continuous with the cytoskeletal network and exhibit characteristic arrangements at different stages of prophase. Quantitative measurements confirmed that SUN1/KASH5, microtubules, and dynein, but not actin, were necessary for RPMs and that defects in meiotic recombination and synapsis resulted in altered RPMs.},

abstract = {It is believed that in most animals only the paternal centrosome provides the division poles for mitosis in zygotes. This paternal inheritance of the centrosomes depends on the selective loss of the maternal centrosome. In order to understand the mechanism of centrosome inheritance, the behavior of all maternal centrosomes/centrioles was investigated throughout the meiotic and mitotic cycles by using starfish eggs that had polar body (PB) formation suppressed. In starfish oocytes, the centrioles do not duplicate during meiosis II. Hence, each centrosome of the meiosis II spindle has only one centriole, whereas in meiosis I, each has a pair of centrioles. When two pairs of meiosis I centrioles were retained in the cytoplasm of oocytes by complete suppression of PB extrusion, they separated into four single centrioles in meiosis II. However, after completion of the meiotic process, only two of the four single centrioles were found in addition to the pronucleus. When the two single centrioles of a meiosis II spindle were retained in the oocyte cytoplasm by suppressing the extrusion of the second PB, only one centriole was found with the pronucleus after the completion of the meiotic process. When these PB-suppressed eggs were artificially activated to drive the mitotic cycles, all the surviving single centrioles duplicated repeatedly to form pairs of centrioles, which could organize mitotic spindles. These results indicate that the maternal centrioles are not equivalent in their intrinsic stability and reproductive capacity. The centrosomes with the reproductive centrioles are selectively cast off into the PBs, resulting in the mature egg inheriting a nonreproductive centriole, which would degrade shortly after the completion of meiosis. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

abstract = {RanGTP is important for chromosome-dependent spindle assembly in Xenopus extracts. Here we report on experiments to determine the role of the Ran pathway on microtubule dynamics in Drosophila oocytes and embryos. Females expressing a dominant-negative form of Ran have fertility defects, suggesting that RanGTP is required for normal fertility. This is not, however, because of a defect in acentrosomal meiotic spindle assembly. Therefore, RanGTP does not appear to be essential or sufficient for the formation of the acentrosomal spindle. Instead, the most important function of the Ran pathway in spindle assembly appears to be in the tapering of microtubules at the spindle poles, which might be through regulation of proteins such as TACC and the HURP homolog, Mars. One consequence of this spindle organization defect is an increase in the nondisjunction of achiasmate chromosomes. However, the meiotic defects are not severe enough to cause the decreased fertility. Reductions in fertility occur because RanGTP has a role in microtubule assembly that is not directly nucleated by the chromosomes. This includes microtubules nucleated from the sperm aster, which are required for pronuclear fusion. We propose that following nuclear envelope breakdown, RanGTP is released from the nucleus and creates a cytoplasm that is activated for assembling microtubules, which is important for processes such as pronuclear fusion. Around the chromosomes, however, RanGTP might be redundant with other factors such as the chromosome passenger complex. {\textcopyright} 2011. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.},

abstract = {In contrast to the somatic cell cycle, duplication of the centrioles does not occur in the second meiotic cycle. Previous studies have revealed that in starfish each of the two centrosomes in fully-grown immature oocytes consists of two centrioles with different destinies: one survives and retains its reproductive capacity, and the other is lost after completion of meiosis. In this study, we investigated whether this heterogeneity of the meiotic centrioles is already determined before the re-initiation of meiosis. We prepared a small fragment of immature oocyte containing the four centrioles and fused it electrically with a mature egg in order to transfer two sets of the premeiotic centrioles into the mature cytoplasm. Two asters were present in this conjugate, and in each of them only a single centriole was detected by electron microscopy. In the first mitosis of the conjugate artificially activated without sperm, two division poles formed, each of which doubled in each subsequent round of mitosis. These results indicate that only two of the four premeiotic centrioles survived in the mature cytoplasm and that they retained their reproductive capacity, which suggests that the heterogeneity of the maternal centrioles is determined well before re-initiation of meiosis, and that some factor in the mature cytoplasm is responsible for suppressing the reproductive capacity of the centrioles destined to decay.},

In budding yeast there is a single importin-$\alpha$ gene and in higher eukaryotes there are multiple importin-$\alpha$-like genes, but in fission yeast there are two: the previously characterized cut15 and the more recently identified imp1. Like other importin-$\alpha$ family members, Imp1p supports nuclear protein import in vitro. In contrast to cut15, imp1 is not essential for viability, but imp1$\Delta$ mutant cells exhibit a telophase delay and mild temperature-sensitive lethality. Differences in the cellular functions that depend on Imp1p and Cut15p indicate that they each have unique physiological roles. They also have common roles because the imp1$\Delta$ and the cut15-85 temperature-sensitive mutations are synthetically lethal; overexpression of cut15 partially suppresses the temperature sensitivity, but not the mitotic delay in imp1$\Delta$ cells; and overexpression of imp1 partially suppresses the mitotic defect in cut15-85 cells but not the loss of viability. Both Imp1p and Cut15p are required for the efficient nuclear import of both an SV40 nuclear localization signal-containing reporter protein and the Pap1p component of the stress response MAP kinase pathway.

Remarkably, mammalian oocytes do not contain canonical centrosomes. This study reveals that mouse oocytes assemble a bipolar spindle by fragmenting multiple acentriolar microtubule-organizing centres (MTOCs) into a high number of small MTOCs to be able to then regroup and merge them into two equal spindle poles. We show that MTOCs are fragmented in a three-step process. First, PLK1 triggers a decondensation of the MTOC structure. Second, BicD2-anchored dynein stretches the MTOCs into fragmented ribbons along the nuclear envelope. Third, KIF11 further fragments the MTOCs following nuclear envelope breakdown so that they can be evenly distributed towards the two spindle poles. Failure to fragment MTOCs leads to defects in spindle assembly, which delay chromosome individualization and congression, putting the oocyte at risk of aneuploidy.},

abstract = {In many animals, the bipolar spindle of the first zygotic division is established after the contribution of centrioles by the sperm at fertilization. To avoid the formation of a multipolar spindle in the zygote, centrosomes are eliminated during oogenesis in most organisms, although the mechanism of this selective elimination is poorly understood. We show that cki-2, a Caenorhabditis elegans cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor, is required for their appropriate elimination during oogenesis. In the absence of cki-2, embryos have supernumerary centrosomes and form multipolar spindles that result in severe aneuploidy after anaphase of the first division. Moreover, we demonstrate that this defect can be suppressed by reducing cyclin E or Cdk2 levels. This implies that the proper regulation of a cyclin E-Cdk complex by cki-2 is required for the elimination of the centrosome that occurs before or during oogenesis to ensure the assembly of a bipolar spindle in the C. elegans zygote. {\textcopyright} The Rockefeller University Press.},

The failure of microtubule stabilization caused by depletion of the chromosomal passenger complex was rescued by codepletion of the microtubule-depolymerizing kinesin MCAK, whose activity is negatively regulated by Aurora B. By contrast, we present evidence that the Ran-GTP pathway of chromatin-induced microtubule nucleation does not require the chromosomal passenger complex, indicating that the mechanisms of microtubule assembly by these two pathways are distinct.

abstract = {Meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) initiate crossover (CO) recombination, which is necessary for accurate chromosome segregation, but DSBs may also repair as non-crossovers (NCOs). Multiple recombination pathways with specific intermediates are expected to lead to COs and NCOs. We revisited the mechanisms of meiotic DSB repair and the regulation of CO formation, by conducting a genome-wide analysis of strand-transfer intermediates associated with recombination events. We performed this analysis in a SK1 × S288C Saccharomyces cerevisiae hybrid lacking the mismatch repair (MMR) protein Msh2, to allow efficient detection of heteroduplex DNAs (hDNAs). First, we observed that the anti-recombinogenic activity of MMR is responsible for a 20% drop in CO number, suggesting that in MMR-proficient cells some DSBs are repaired using the sister chromatid as a template when polymorphisms are present. Second, we observed that a large fraction of NCOs were associated with trans-hDNA tracts constrained to a single chromatid. This unexpected finding is compatible with dissolution of double Holliday junctions (dHJs) during repair, and it suggests the existence of a novel control point for CO formation at the level of the dHJ intermediate, in addition to the previously described control point before the dHJ formation step. Finally, we observed that COs are associated with complex hDNA patterns, confirming that the canonical double-strand break repair model is not sufficient to explain the formation of most COs. We propose that multiple factors contribute to the complexity of recombination intermediates. These factors include repair of nicks and double-stranded gaps, template switches between non-sister and sister chromatids, and HJ branch migration. Finally, the good correlation between the strand transfer properties observed in the absence of and in the presence of Msh2 suggests that the intermediates detected in the absence of Msh2 reflect normal intermediates. {\textcopyright} 2011 Martini et al.},

Centrosomes represent the major microtubule organizing center (MTOC) in eukaryotic cells and are responsible for nucleation of the spindle, the vehicle of chromosome segregation. In human female meiosis, however, spindle assembly occurs in the absence of centrosomes or other MTOCs and microtubules are nucleated around chromosomes. In yeast, spindle formation in mitosis and meiosis depends on the activity of spindle pole bodies (SPBs), the functional equivalents of centrosomes; thus, SPBs and centrosomes use similar machineries to assemble spindles. Here, we develop a system to explore the molecular mechanisms supporting acentrosomal spindle formation using fission yeast meiosis as a model scenario. We achieve this situation by removing access of the SPBs to the nucleus after their duplication. Under these conditions, we observe self-assembly-based spindle formation in the nuclear environment, conferring an ability to segregate chromosomes independently of the SPBs. Our results open the possibility to utilize the experimental advantages of fission yeast for insights into the molecular basis of acentrosomal spindle formation in meiosis.},

abstract = {Chromosome pairing in meiotic prophase is a prerequisite for the high fidelity of chromosome segregation that haploidizes the genome prior to gamete formation. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as in most multicellular eukaryotes, homologous pairing at the cytological level reflects the contemporaneous search for homology at the molecular level, where DNA double-strand broken ends find and interact with templates for repair on homologous chromosomes. Synapsis (synaptonemal complex formation) stabilizes pairing and supports DNA repair. The bouquet stage, where telomeres have formed a transient single cluster early in meiotic prophase, and telomere-promoted rapid meiotic prophase chromosome movements (RPMs) are prominent temporal correlates of pairing and synapsis. The bouquet has long been thought to contribute to the kinetics of pairing, but the individual roles of bouquet and RPMs are difficult to assess because of common dependencies. For example, in budding yeast RPMs and bouquet both require the broadly conserved SUN protein Mps3 as well as Ndj1 and Csm4, which link telomeres to the cytoskeleton through the intact nuclear envelope. We find that mutants in these genes provide a graded series of RPM activity: wild-type>mps3-dCC>mps3-dAR>ndj1$\Delta$>mps3-dNT = csm4$\Delta$. Pairing rates are directly correlated with RPM activity even though only wild-type forms a bouquet, suggesting that RPMs promote homologous pairing directly while the bouquet plays at most a minor role in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A new collision trap assay demonstrates that RPMs generate homologous and heterologous chromosome collisions in or before the earliest stages of prophase, suggesting that RPMs contribute to pairing by stirring the nuclear contents to aid the recombination-mediated homology search. {\textcopyright} 2012 Lee et al.},

Although it is known that the centromere and kinetochore are responsible for chromosome movement in meiosis as in mitosis, potential specialized meiotic functions are being uncovered. Centromere pairing early in meiosis I, even between nonhomologous chromosomes, and clustering of centromeres can promote proper homolog associations in meiosis I in yeast, plants, and Drosophila. It was not known, however, whether centromere proteins are required for this clustering. We exploited Drosophila mutants for the centromere proteins centromere protein-C (CENP-C) and chromosome alignment 1 (CAL1) to demonstrate that a functional centromere is needed for centromere clustering and pairing. The cenp-C and cal1 mutations result in Cterminal truncations, removing the domains through which these two proteins interact. The mutants show striking genetic interactions, failing to complement as double heterozygotes, resulting in disrupted centromere clustering and meiotic nondisjunction. The cluster of meiotic centromeres localizes to the nucleolus, and this association requires centromere function. In Drosophila, synaptonemal complex (SC) formation can initiate from the centromere, and the SC is retained at the centromere after it disassembles from the chromosome arms. Although functional CENP-C and CAL1 are dispensable for assembly of the SC, they are required for subsequent retention of the SC at the centromere. These results show that integral centromere proteins are required for nuclear position and intercentromere associations in meiosis.},

The bouquet formation plays an important role in homologous chromosome pairing and therefore progression of meiosis. As meiotic telomere clustering occurs in response to mating pheromone signaling in fission yeast, we looked for factors essential for bouquet formation among genes induced under mating pheromone signaling. This genome-wide search identified two proteins, Bqt1 and Bqt2, that connect telomeres to the spindle-pole body (SPB; the centrosome equivalent in fungi). Neither Bqt1 nor Bqt2 alone functions as a connector, but together the two proteins form a bridge between Rap1 (a telomere protein) and Sad1 (an SPB protein). Significantly, when both Bqt1 and Bqt2 are ectopically expressed in mitotic cells, they also form a bridge between Rap1 and Sad1. Thus, a complex including Bqt1 and Bqt2 is essential for connecting telomeres to the SPB. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The presence of a PC on just one copy of a chromosome pair promotes synapsis but does not support synapsis-independent pairing stabilization, indicating that these functions are separable. Once initiated, synapsis is highly processive, even between nonhomologous chromosomes of disparate lengths, elucidating how translocations suppress meiotic recombination in C. elegans. These findings suggest a multistep pathway for chromosome synapsis in which PCs impart selectivity and efficiency through a "kinetic proofreading" mechanism. We speculate that concentration of these activities at one region per chromosome may have coevolved with the loss of a point centromere to safeguard karyotype stability. {\textcopyright}2005 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {During meiosis, each chromosome must pair with its unique homologous partner, a process that usually culminates with the formation of the synaptonemal complex (SC). In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, special regions on each chromosome known as pairing centers are essential for both homologous pairing and synapsis. We report that during early meiosis, pairing centers establish transient connections to the cytoplasmic microtubule network. These connections through the intact nuclear envelope require the SUN/KASH domain protein pair SUN-1 and ZYG-12. Disruption of microtubules inhibits chromosome pairing, indicating that these connections promote interhomolog interactions. Dynein activity is essential to license formation of the SC once pairing has been accomplished, most likely by overcoming a barrier imposed by the chromosome-nuclear envelope connection. Our findings thus provide insight into how homolog pairing is accomplished in meiosis and into the mechanisms regulating synapsis so that it occurs selectively between homologs.

abstract = {The multisubunit $\gamma$-tubulin complex ($\gamma$-TuC) is critical for microtubule nucleation in eukaryotic cells [1, 2], but it remains unclear how the $\gamma$-TuC becomes active specifically at microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) and not more broadly throughout the cytoplasm [3, 4]. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the proteins Mto1 and Mto2 form the Mto1/2 complex, which interacts with the $\gamma$-TuC and recruits it to several different types of cytoplasmic MTOC sites [5-10]. Here, we show that the Mto1/2 complex activates $\gamma$-TuC-dependent microtubule nucleation independently of localizing the $\gamma$-TuC. This was achieved through the construction of a "minimal" version of Mto1/2, Mto1/2[bonsai], that does not localize to any MTOC sites. By direct imaging of individual Mto1/2[bonsai] complexes nucleating single microtubules in vivo, we further determine the number and stoichiometry of Mto1, Mto2, and $\gamma$-TuC subunits Alp4 (GCP2) and Alp6 (GCP3) within active nucleation complexes. These results are consistent with active nucleation complexes containing ∼13 copies each of Mto1 and Mto2 per active complex and likely equimolar amounts of $\gamma$-tubulin. Additional experiments suggest that Mto1/2 multimers act to multimerize the fission yeast $\gamma$-tubulin small complex and that multimerization of Mto2 in particular may underlie assembly of active microtubule nucleation complexes. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Background: Meiosis is essential for sexual reproduction and generates genetically diverse haploid gametes from a diploid germ cell. Reduction of ploidy depends on active chromosome movements during early meiotic prophase I. Chromosome movements require telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope. This attachment is mediated by telomere adaptor proteins. Telomere adaptor proteins have to date been identified in fission yeast and mice. In the mouse, they form a complex composed of the meiotic proteins TERB1, TERB2, and MAJIN. No sequence similarity was observed between these three mouse proteins and the adaptor proteins of fission yeast, raising the question of the evolutionary history and significance of this specific protein complex. Result: Here, we show the TERB1, TERB2, and MAJIN proteins are found throughout the Metazoa and even in early-branching non-bilateral phyla such as Cnidaria, Placozoa and Porifera. Metazoan TERB1, TERB2, and MAJIN showed comparable domain architecture across all clades. Furthermore, the protein domains involved in the formation of the complex as well as those involved for the interaction with the telomere shelterin protein and the LINC complexes revealed high sequence similarity. Finally, gene expression in the cnidarian Hydra vulgaris provided evidence that the TERB1-TERB2-MAJIN complex is selectively expressed in the germ line. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the TERB1-TERB2-MAJIN complex has an ancient origin in metazoans, suggesting conservation of meiotic functions.},

How centrioles are eliminated remains poorly understood. Here we visualize the entire elimination process live in starfish oocytes. Using specific fluorescent markers, we demonstrate that the two older, mother centrioles are selectively removed from the oocyte by extrusion into polar bodies. We show that this requires specific positioning of the second meiotic spindle, achieved by dynein-driven transport, and anchorage of the mother centriole to the plasma membrane via mother-specific appendages. In contrast, the single daughter centriole remaining in the egg is eliminated before the first embryonic cleavage. We demonstrate that these distinct elimination mechanisms are necessary because if mother centrioles are artificially retained, they cannot be inactivated, resulting in multipolar zygotic spindles. Thus, our findings reveal a dual mechanism to eliminate centrioles: mothers are physically removed, whereas daughters are eliminated in the cytoplasm, preparing the egg for fertilization.},

abstract = {Chromosome segregation in female meiosis in many metazoans is mediated by acentrosomal spindles, the existence of which implies that microtubule spindles self-assemble without the participation of the centrosomes. Although it is thought that acentrosomal meiosis is not conserved in fungi, we recently reported the formation of self-assembled microtubule arrays, which were able to segregate chromosomes, in fission yeast mutants, in which the contribution of the spindle pole body (SPB; the centrosome equivalent in yeast) was specifically blocked during meiosis. Here, we demonstrate that this unexpected microtubule formation represents a bona fide type of acentrosomal spindle. Moreover, a comparative analysis of these self-assembled spindles and the canonical SPB-dependent spindle reveals similarities and differences; for example, both spindles have a similar polarity, but the location of the $\gamma$-tubulin complex differs. We also show that the robustness of self-assembled spindles can be reinforced by eliminating kinesin-8 family members, whereas kinesin-8 mutants have an adverse impact on SPB-dependent spindles. Hence, we consider that reinforced self-assembled spindles in yeast will help to clarify the molecular mechanisms behind acentrosomal meiosis, a crucial step towards better understanding gametogenesis.},

Centrosomes have acquired various accessory structures to facilitate these disparate functions.

abstract = {The assembly of a bipolar microtubule-based spindle is crucial for the accurate and timely segregation of the chromosomes into the two daughter cells during mitosis.Three microtubule nucleation pathways function in mitotic cells to contribute microtubules to the assembling spindle, namely the centrosome-, chromatin- and microtubule-mediated pathways.Microtubules nucleated from the centrosomes find the chromosomes via 'search and capture' — a process that relies on the dynamic instability of microtubules — which allows them to search space to contact the chromosomes. When a microtubule contacts a kinetochore, it is captured and becomes stabilized to form kinetochore fibres (K-fibres).The speed and efficiency of chromosome capture is promoted by the chromatin-mediated pathway that biases microtubule nucleation and stabilization to the vicinity of the chromosomes.Microtubules are also generated from within the spindle itself via Augmin, which promotes microtubule nucleation from pre-existing microtubules. This nucleation increases the density of microtubules within the spindle and thus contributes to its robustness.Although the nucleation pathways are at least partially redundant, they are integrated to provide an intricate balance of microtubule nucleation that ensures the fidelity of chromosome segregation and the timely completion of mitosis. In the absence of any one of the pathways, spindle assembly still occurs — although with increased use of the remaining pathways — but mitosis takes longer and this can result in genome instability.},

These meiosis-specific chromosome structures provide specialized environments for the regulation of DSB formation and crossing over. In this review, we summarize insights into the importance of chromosome architecture in the regulation of meiotic recombination, focusing on cohesin-mediated axis formation, DSB regulation via tethered loop-axis complexes, inter-homolog template bias facilitated by axial proteins, and crossover regulation in the context of the SCs.

While much is understood about the molecular parts of centrosomes, very little is known about their functional material properties. Two prevalent hypotheses pose that the centrosome is either a liquid droplet or a solid lattice. However, many material states exist between a pure Newtonian liquid and a crystalline solid, and it is not clear where centrosomes lie along this spectrum. Furthermore, broad terms like “liquid” or “solid” do not reveal functional properties like strength, ductility, elasticity, and toughness, which are more relevant to understand how centrosomes resist forces.

To answer questions raised by centriole disappearance during oogenesis, using a transgenic mouse expressing GFP-centrin-2 (GFP CETN2), we traced their presence from e11.5 primordial germ cells (PGCs) through oogenesis and their ultimate dissolution in mature oocytes. We show tightly coupled CETN2 doublets in PGCs, oogonia, and pre-pubertal oocytes. Beginning with follicular recruitment of incompetent germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes, through full oocyte maturation, the CETN2 doublets separate within the pericentriolar material (PCM) and a rise in single CETN2 pairs is identified, mostly at meiotic metaphase-I and -II spindle poles. Partial CETN2 foci dissolution occurs even as other centriole markers, like Cep135, a protein necessary for centriole duplication, are maintained at the PCM. Furthermore, live imaging demonstrates that the link between the two centrioles breaks as meiosis resumes and that centriole association with the PCM is progressively lost. Microtubule inhibition shows that centriole dissolution is uncoupled from microtubule dynamics. Thus, centriole doublets, present in early G2-arrested meiotic prophase oocytes, begin partial reduction during follicular recruitment and meiotic resumption, later than previously thought.},

Our theory describing one possible explanation for the transfer of these antigens from the chromosomes to the spindle midzone at the metaphase: anaphase transition must now be subjected to further experimental tests. The phenotypes of cells microinjected with antibodies to passenger proteins should enable us to identify mitotic processes dependent on these proteins, as in the example of CHO1 antibody blocking mitotic progression (Nislow et al. 1990). In addition, the availability of cDNA clones and high titer antibodies may enable homologues of these components to be identified in organisms in which they can be subjected to genetic analysis. For the time being, we suggest that current views of the relative roles of chromosomes and cytoskeletal components in mitosis may require revision. Our hypothesis takes the current model for the role of the kinetochores in organizing the bipolar mitotic spindle (Kirschner and Mitchison 1986) a step further.

abstract = {Centrosomes, the main microtubule organizing centers in a cell, are nonmembrane-bound semi-conservative organelles consisting of numerous centrosome proteins that typically surround a pair of perpendicularly oriented cylindrical centrioles. Centrosome matrix is therefore oftentimes referred to as pericentriolar material (PCM). Through their microtubule organizing functions centrosomes are also crucial for transport and distribution of cell organelles such as mitochondria and macromolecular complexes. Centrosomes undergo cell cycle-specific reorganizations and dynamics. Many of the centrosome-associated proteins are transient and cell cycle-specific while others, such as $\gamma$-tubulin, are permanently associated with centrosome structure. During gametogenesis, the spermatozoon retains its proximal centriole while losing most of the PCM, whereas the oocyte degenerates centrioles while retaining centrosomal proteins. In most mammals including humans, the spermatozoon contributes the proximal centriole during fertilization. Biparental centrosome contributions to the zygote are typical for most species with some exceptions such as the mouse in which centrosomes are maternally inherited and centrioles are assembled de novo during the blastocyst stage. After nuclear transfer in reconstructed embryos, the donor cell centrosome complex is responsible for carrying out functions that are typically fulfilled by the sperm centrosome complex during normal fertilization, including spindle organization, cell cycle progression and development. In rodents, donor cell centrioles are degraded after nuclear transfer, and centrosomal proteins from both donor cell and recipient oocytes contribute to mitotic spindle assembly. However, questions remain about the faithful reprogramming of centrosomes in cloned mammals and its consequences for embryo development. The molecular dynamics of donor cell centrosomes in nuclear transfer eggs need further analysis. The fate and functions of centrosome components in nuclear transfer embryosare being investigated by using molecular imaging of centrosome proteins labeled with specific markers including, but not limited to, green fluorescent protein (GFP). {\textcopyright} 2007 Landes Bioscience and Springer Sciencet+Business Media, LLC.},

Fluorescence in situ hybridization in fission yeast indicated that chromosomal loci are positioned in an ordered manner as anticipated from the bouquet arrangement. Blocking the formation of the telomere cluster with the kms1 mutation created a disorganized chromosomal arrangement, not only for the regions proximal to the telomere but also for interstitial regions. The kms1 mutation also affected the positioning of a linear minichromosome. Consistent with this cytological observation, the frequency of ectopic homologous recombination between a linear minichromosome and a normal chromosome increased in the kms1 background. Intragenic recombination between allelic loci is reduced in the kms1 mutant, but those between non-allelic loci are unaffected or slightly increased. Thus, telomere-led chromosome organization facilitates homologous pairing and also restricts irregular chromosome pairing during meiosis.},

abstract = {We have investigated the requirements for NDJ1 in meiotic telomere redistribution and clustering in synchronized cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. On induction of wild-type meiosis, telomeres disperse from premeiotic aggregates over the nuclear periphery, and then cluster near the spindle pole body (bouquet arrangement) before dispersing again. In ndj1$\Delta$ meiocytes, telomeres are scattered throughout the nucleus and fail to form perinuclear meiosis-specific distribution patterns, suggesting that Ndj1p may function to tether meiotic telomeres to the nuclear periphery. Since ndj1$\Delta$ meiocytes fail to cluster their telomeres at any prophase stage, Ndj1p is the first protein shown to be required for bouquet formation in a synaptic organism. Analysis of homologue pairing by two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization with cosmid probes to regions on III, IX, and XI revealed that disruption of bouquet formation is associated with a significant delay (>2 h) of homologue pairing. An increased and persistent fraction of ndj1$\Delta$ meiocytes with Zip1p polycomplexes suggests that chromosome polarization is important for synapsis progression. Thus, our observations support the hypothesis that meiotic telomere clustering contributes to efficient homologue alignment and synaptic pairing. Under naturally occurring conditions, bouquet formation may allow for rapid sporulation and confer a selective advantage.},

abstract = {The centrosome is the main MT organizing center in animal cells, and has traditionally been regarded as essential for organization of the bipolar spindle that facilitates chromosome segregation during mitosis. Centrosomes are associated with the poles of the mitotic spindle, and several cell types require these organelles for spindle formation. However, most plant cells and some female meiotic systems get along without this organelle, and centrosome-independent spindle assembly has now been identified within some centrosome containing cells. How can such observations, which point to mutually incompatible conclusions regarding the requirement of Centrosomes in spindle formation, be interpreted? With emphasis on the functional role of Centrosomes, this article summarizes the current models of spindle formation, and outlines how observations obtained from spindle assembly assays in vitro may reconcile conflicting opinions about the mechanism of spindle assembly. It is further described how Drosophila mutants are used to address the functional interrelationships between individual centrosomal proteins and spindle formation in vivo. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Topoisomerase II is a ubiquitous enzyme that removes knots and tangles from the genetic material by generating transient double-strand DNA breaks. While the enzyme cannot perform its essential cellular functions without cleaving DNA, this scission activity is inherently dangerous to chromosomal integrity. In fact, etoposide and other clinically important anticancer drugs kill cells by increasing levels of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA breaks. Cells rely heavily on recombination to repair double-strand DNA breaks, but the specific pathways used to repair topoisomerase II-generated DNA damage have not been defined. Therefore, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as a model system to delineate the recombination pathways that repair DNA breaks generated by topoisomerase II. Yeast cells that expressed wild-type or a drug-hypersensitive mutant topoisomerase II or over-expressed the wild-type enzyme were examined. Based on cytotoxicity and recombination induced by etoposide in different repair-deficient genetic backgrounds, double-strand DNA breaks generated by topoisomerase II appear to be repaired primarily by the single-strand invasion pathway of homologous recombination. Non-homologous end joining also was triggered by etoposide treatment, but this pathway was considerably less active than single-strand invasion and did not con ribute significantly to cell survival in S.cerevisiae.},

Here, we show that homologous loci typically pair when the spindle pole body is at the cell pole and the nucleus is elongated, whereas they unpair when the spindle pole body is in the cell center and the nucleus is round. Inhibition of oscillations demonstrated that movement is required for initial pairing and that prolonged association of loci leads to mis-segregation. The double-strand break marker Rec25 accumulates in elongated nuclei, indicating that prolonged chromosome stretching triggers recombinatory pathways leading to mis-segregation. Mis-segregation is rescued by overexpression of the Holliday junction resolvase Mus81, suggesting that prolonged pairing results in irresolvable recombination intermediates. We conclude that nuclear oscillations exhibit a dual role, promoting initial pairing and restricting the time of chromosome associations to ensure proper segregation.},

The sperm centrosome is remodeled by both reduction and enrichment of specific proteins and the formation of these rods during spermatogenesis. In vivo and in vitro investigations show that the flagellum-attached, atypical DC is capable of recruiting PCM, forming a daughter centriole, and localizing to the spindle pole during mitosis. Altogether, we show that the DC is compositionally and structurally remodeled into an atypical centriole, which functions as the zygote's second centriole. These findings now provide novel avenues for diagnostics and therapeutic strategies for male infertility, and insights into early embryo developmental defects.},

abstract = {Oocyte meiotic spindles of many species are anastral and lack centrosomes to nucleate microtubules. Assembly of anastral spindles occurs by a pathway that differs from that of most mitotic spindles. Here we analyze assembly of the Drosophila oocyte meiosis I spindle and the role of the Nonclaret disjunctional (Ncd) motor in spindle assembly using wild-type and mutant Ncd fused to GFP. Unexpectedly, we observe motor-associated asters at germinal vesicle breakdown that migrate towards the condensed chromosomes, where they nucleate microtubules at the chromosomes. Newly nucleated microtubules are randomly oriented, then become organized around the bivalent chromosomes. We show that the meiotic spindle forms by lateral associations of microtubule-coated chromosomes into a bipolar spindle. Lateral interactions between microtubule-associated bivalent chromosomes may be mediated by microtubule crosslinking by the Ncd motor, based on analysis of fixed oocytes. We report here that spindle assembly occurs in an ncd mutant defective for microtubule motility, but lateral interactions between microtubule-coated chromosomes are unstable, indicating that Ncd movement along microtubules is needed to stabilize interactions between chromosomes. A more severe ncd mutant that probably lacks ATPase activity prevents formation of lateral interactions between chromosomes and causes defective microtubule elongation. Anastral Drosophila oocyte meiosis I spindle assembly thus involves motor-associated asters to nucleate microtubules and Ncd motor activity to form and stabilize interactions between microtubule-associated chromosomes during the assembly process. This is the first complete account of assembly of an anastral spindle and the specific steps that require Ncd motor activity, revealing new and unexpected features of the process.},

The mat1 switching-mechanism-generated DSB found in mitotically growing cells can be repaired without mat1 switching, since strains deleted for both donor loci (mat2-P and mat3-M) have the break but do not produce inviable cells. A (mat1-P × mat1-M) cross produced a high frequency (20%) of 3:1 gene conversions of mat1 in meiotic tetrads. Gene conversion events were associated with the recombination of flanking markers.

This checkpoint is activated in the absence of either an actomyosin division ring [1] or astral microtubules [2]. Although the SOC could be overridden in the absence of the transcription factor Atf1p, its mechanistic nature remained unclear. Here, we show that the SOC-triggered metaphase delay depends on a subset of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) components Mph1p and Bub1p. Based on this finding and a detailed imaging of the spindle orientation process, we hypothesized that the spindle pole might contain proteins capable of sensing the achievement of spindle alignment. We identified the kendrin-like spindle pole body resident Pcp1p as a candidate molecule. A targeted mutation in its central domain specifically triggered the SOC in spite of the presence of oriented spindles, causing a metaphase delay that could be relieved in the absence of Mph1p, Bub1p, and Atf1p. Thus, Pcp1p might provide a link between the mechanical process of spindle alignment and the signal transduction that initiates anaphase.},

The proteins TACC3, CCP110, CKAP5, and DISC1 were found to be essential components of the huoMTOC. The huoMTOC arises beneath the oocyte cortex and migrates adjacent to the nuclear envelope before nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD). After NEBD, the huoMTOC fragments and relocates on the kinetochores to initiate microtubule nucleation and spindle assembly. Disrupting the huoMTOC led to spindle assembly defects and oocyte maturation arrest. These results reveal a physiological mechanism of huoMTOC-regulated spindle assembly in human oocytes.},

abstract = {Earlier results from sectioned nuclei indicating that Schizosaccharomyces pombe does not develop a classical tripartite synaptonemal complex (SC) during meiotic prophase are confirmed by spreading of whole nuclei. The linear elements appearing during prophase I resemble the axial cores (SC precursors) of other organisms. The number of linear elements in haploid, diploid, and tetraploid strains is always higher than the chromosome number, implying that they are not formed continuously along the chromosomes. Time course experiments reveal that the elements appear after DNA replication and form networks and bundles. Later they separate and $\sim$24 individual elements with a total length of 34 $\mu$m are observed before degradation and meiotic divisions. Parallel staining of DNA reveals changes in nuclear shape during meiotic prophase. Strains with a mei4 mutation are blocked at a late prophase stage. In serial sections we additionally observed a constant arrangement of the spindle pole body, the nucleolus, and the presumptive centromere cluster. Thus, S. pombe manages to recombine and segregate its chromosomes without SC. This might correlate with the absence of crossover interference. We propose a mechanism for chromosome pairing with initial recognition of the homologs at the centromeres and suggest functions of the linear elements in preparation of the chromosomes for meiosis I disjunction. With the spreading technique combined genetic, molecular, and cytological approaches become feasible in S. pombe. This provides an opportunity to study essential meiotic functions in the absence of SCs which may help to clarify the significance of the SC and its components for meiotic chromosome structure and function.},

During meiotic prophase, in a conserved chromosomal configuration called the bouquet, telomeres gather to the nuclear membrane (NM), often near centrosomes. We found previously that upon disruption of the fission yeast bouquet, centrosomes failed to insert into the NM at meiosis I and nucleate bipolar spindles. Hence, the trans-NM association of telomeres with centrosomes during prophase is crucial for efficient spindle formation. Nonetheless, in approximately half of bouquet-deficient meiocytes, spindles form properly. Here, we show that bouquet-deficient cells can successfully undergo meiosis using centromere-centrosome contact instead of telomere-centrosome contact to generate spindle formation. Accordingly, forced association between centromeres and centrosomes fully rescued the spindle defects incurred by bouquet disruption. Telomeres and centromeres both stimulate focal accumulation of the SUN domain protein Sad1 beneath the centrosome, suggesting a molecular underpinning for their shared spindlegenerating ability. Our observations demonstrate an unanticipated level of interchangeability between the two most prominent chromosomal landmarks.},

abstract = {Centrioles organize microtubules in two ways: either microtubules elongate from the centriole cylinder itself, forming a flagellum or a cilium ('template elongation'), or pericentriolar material assembles and nucleates a microtubule aster ('astral nucleation'). During spermatogenesis in most species, a motile flagellum elongates from one of the sperm centrioles, whereas after fertilization a large aster of microtubules forms around the sperm centrioles in the egg cytoplasm. Using Xenopus egg extracts we have developed an in vitro system to study this change in microtubule-organizing activity. An aster of microtubules forms around the centrioles of permeabilized frog sperm in egg extracts, but not in pure tubulin. However, when the sperm heads are incubated in the egg extract in the presence of nocodazole, they are able to nucleate a microtubule aster after isolation and incubation with pure calf brain tubulin. This provides a two-step assay that distinguishes between centrosome assembly and subsequent microtubule nucleation. We have studied several centrosomal antigens during centrosome assembly. The CTR2611 antigen is present in the sperm head in the peri- centriolar region. $\gamma$-tubulin and certain phosphorylated epitopes appear in the centrosome only after incubation in the egg extract. $\gamma$-tubulin is recruited from the egg extract and associated with electron-dense patches dispersed in a wide area around the centrioles. Immunodepletion of $\gamma$- tubulin and associated molecules from the egg extract before sperm head incubation prevents the change in microtubule-organizing activity of the sperm heads. This suggests that $\gamma$-tubulin and/or associated molecules play a key role in centrosome formation and activity.},

abstract = {Sexual reproduction requires the generation of gametes, which are highly specialised for fertilisation. Female reproductive cells, oocytes, grow up to large sizes when they accumulate energy stocks and store proteins as well as mRNAs to enable rapid cell divisions after fertilisation. At the same time, metazoan oocytes eliminate their centrosomes, i.e., major microtubule-organizing centres (MTOCs), during or right after the long growth phases. Centrosome elimination poses two key questions: first, how can the centrosome be re-established after fertilisation? In general, metazoan oocytes exploit sperm components, i.e., the basal body of the sperm flagellum, as a platform to reinitiate centrosome production. Second, how do most metazoan oocytes manage to build up meiotic spindles without centrosomes? Oocytes have evolved mechanisms to assemble bipolar spindles solely around their chromosomes without the guidance of pre-formed MTOCs. Female animal meiosis involves microtubule nucleation and organisation into bipolar microtubule arrays in regulated self-assembly under the control of the Ran system and nuclear transport receptors. This review summarises our current understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying self-assembly of meiotic spindles, its spatio-temporal regulation, and the key players governing this process in animal oocytes.},

abstract = {Meiotic chromosome segregation requires homologue pairing, synapsis, and crossover recombination, which occur during meiotic prophase. Telomere-led chromosome motion has been observed or inferred to occur during this stage in diverse species, but its mechanism and function remain enigmatic. In Caenorhabditis elegans, special chromosome regions known as pairing centers (PCs), rather than telomeres, associate with the nuclear envelope (NE) and the microtubule cytoskeleton. In this paper, we investigate chromosome dynamics in living animals through high-resolution four-dimensional fluorescence imaging and quantitative motion analysis. We find that chromosome movement is constrained before meiosis. Upon prophase onset, constraints are relaxed, and PCs initiate saltatory, processive, dynein-dependent motions along the NE. These dramatic motions are dispensable for homologous pairing and continue until synapsis is completed. These observations are consistent with the idea that motions facilitate pairing by enhancing the search rate but that their primary function is to trigger synapsis. This quantitative analysis of chromosome dynamics in a living animal extends our understanding of the mechanisms governing faithful genome inheritance. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wynne et al.},

As cells transition from interphase to mitosis, the duplicated centrosomes separate and move to opposite sides of the cell where the spindle assembles. Centrosomes not only nucleate but also organize microtubules of the mitotic spindle. The mitotic spindle is anchored to the cell cortex by the astral microtubules emanating from the centrosomes. Proper orientation of the mitotic spindle is essential for correct cell division. Centrosome-localized polo-like kinase Plk1 has been linked to regulation of proper spindle orientation. A number of proteins including MISP and NuMA have been implicated in the Plk1-mediated spindle orientation pathway.},

A highly conserved change is the clustering of telomeres at the nuclear periphery to form the "bouquet" configuration. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe the bouquet and associated nuclear movement facilitate initial interactions between homologs. We show that Bqt2, a meiosis-specific protein required for bouquet formation, is required for wild-type levels of homolog pairing and meiotic allelic recombination. Both gene conversion and crossing over are reduced and exhibit negative interference in bqt2$\Delta$ mutants, reflecting reduced homolog pairing. While both the bouquet and nuclear movement promote pairing, only the bouquet restricts ectopic recombination (that between dispersed repetitive DNA). We discuss mechanisms by which the bouquet may prevent deleterious translocations by restricting ectopic recombination. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2006 by the Genetics Society of America.},

abstract = {We have identified and analyzed a meiotic reciprocal recombination hot spot in S. cerevisiae. We find that double-strand breaks occur at two specific sites associated with the hot spot and that occurrence of these breaks depends upon meiotic recombination functions RAD50 and SPO11. Furthermore, these breaks occur in a processed form in wild-type cells and in a discrete, unprocessed form in certain nonnull rad50 mutants, rad50S, which block meiotic prophase at an intermediate stage. The breaks observed in wild-type cells are similar to those identified independently at another recombination hot spot, ARG4. We show here that the breaks at ARG4 also occur in discrete form in rad50S mutants. Occurrence of breaks in rad50S mutants is also dependent upon SPO11 function. These observations provide additional evidence that double-strand breaks are a prominent feature of meiotic recombination in yeast. More importantly, these observations begin to define a pathway for the physical changes in DNA that lead to recombination and to define the roles of meiotic recombination functions in that pathway. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {The oncogenic protein kinase Aurora A is a critical regulator of meiotic and mitotic cell cycles in eukaryotic cells. Aurora A autoactivation by autophosphorylation is promoted by specific non-catalytic binding proteins. One such protein is TPX2, a required spindle assembly factor in higher eukaryotes whose ability to activate Aurora A by direct binding to the kinase catalytic domain has been established by biochemical and strucrutal analysis. In this report we clarify the autoactivation mechanism of Aurora A by demonstrating that of seven amino acids which become autophosphorylated by Aurora A, only Thr-295 is required for activity. Association of Aurora A with TPX2 leads to activation of the kinase, in parallel with phosphorylation of TPX2. We identify the sites as three Ser residues in the N terminus of TPX2; however, mutation of these residues does not affect Aurora A activation by TPX2. In contrast, the mutation of a putative Aurora A-binding motif in TPX2 abolishes both phosphorylation of TPX2 and activation of Aurora A. We have also investigated the interaction between Xenopus p53 and Xenopus Aurora A. p53 blocks the activity of either full-length Aurora A or the isolated catalytic domain. Interestingly, inhibition is blocked by TPX2, suggesting that the ability of Aurora A to transform cells could be regulated by p53, TPX2, or other binding proteins.},

abstract = {When programmed meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) undergo recombinational repair, genetic crossovers (COs) may be formed. A certain level of this is required for the faithful segregation of chromosomes, but the majority of DSBs are processed toward a safer alternative, namely noncrossovers (NCOs), via nonreciprocal DNA exchange. At the crossroads between these two DSB fates is the Msh4-Msh5 (MutS$\gamma$) complex, which stabilizes CO-destined recombination intermediates and members of the Zip3/RNF212 family of RING finger proteins, which in turn stabilize MutS$\gamma$. These proteins function in the context of the synaptonemal complex (SC) and mainly act on SC-dependent COs. Here we show that in the SC-less ciliate Tetrahymena, Zhp3 (a protein distantly related to Zip3/RNF212), together with MutS$\gamma$, is responsible for the majority of COs. This activity of Zhp3 suggests an evolutionarily conserved SC-independent strategy for balancing CO:NCO ratios. Moreover, we report a novel meiosis-specific protein, Sa15, as an interacting partner of Zhp3. Sa15 forms linear structures in meiotic prophase nuclei to which Zhp3 localizes. Sa15 is required for a wild-type level of CO formation. Its linear organization suggests the existence of an underlying chromosomal axis that serves as a scaffold for Zhp3 and other recombination proteins.},

The gene disruption caused cell lethality, displaying condensed, undivided chromosomes with aberrant spindle structures. Anti-$\gamma$-tubulin staining showed that $\gamma$-tubulin is located, throughout the wild-type cell cycle, at the spindle pole bodies (SPBs), indicating that $\gamma$-tubulin associates with interphase SPB in the absence of microtubules. In addition, anti-$\gamma$-tubulin immunofluorescence staining revealed cytoplasmic, cell-equatorial putative MTOCs (microtubule organizing centers), which appear only during mitotic telophase and cytokinesis, and are located at the centers for the new cytoplasmic microtubule arrays of the two daughter cells. In the multiple-SPB mutant cutl-cdcll, anti-$\gamma$-tubulin antibodies revealed many dots on the periphery of the nucleus. These results confirm that $\gamma$-tubulin is an important member of the tubulin superfamily, suggest that it may be a universal component of MTOCs, and are consistent with a role for $\gamma$-tubulin in controlling microtubule formation in vivo.},

Using proteomics and immunofluorescence studies, we show here that the human zygote inherits a basal body enriched with centrosomal proteins from the sperm, establishing the first functional centrosome of the new organism. Injection of human sperm tails containing the basal body into human oocytes followed by parthenogenetic activation, showed that the centrosome contributes to the robustness of the early cell divisions, increasing the probability of parthenotes reaching the compaction stage. In the absence of the sperm-derived centrosome, pericentriolar material (PCM) components stored in the oocyte can form de novo structures after genome activation, suggesting a tight PCM expression control in zygotes. Our results reveal that the sperm basal body is a complex organelle which converts to a centrosome after fertilization, ensuring the early steps of embryogenesis and successful compaction. However, more experiments are needed to elucidate the exact molecular mechanisms of centrosome inheritance in humans.},

Plants also produce proteins distantly related to their fungal and animal counterparts to regulate critical events such as the spindle assembly checkpoint. Plant spindle assembly initiates with microtubule nucleation on the nuclear envelope followed by bipolarization into the prophase spindle. After nuclear envelope breakdown, kinetochore fibers are assembled and unified into the spindle apparatus with convergent poles. Of note, compared to fungal and animal systems, relatively little is known about how plant cells remodel the spindle microtubule array during anaphase. Uncovering mitotic functions of novel proteins for spindle assembly in plants will illuminate both common and divergent mechanisms employed by different eukaryotic organisms to segregate genetic materials.},

abstract = {During meiotic prophase, telomeres cluster, forming the bouquet chromosome arrangement, and facilitate homologous chromosome pairing. In fission yeast, bouquet formation requires switching of telomere and centromere positions. Centromeres are located at the spindle pole body (SPB) during mitotic interphase, and upon entering meiosis, telomeres cluster at the SPB, followed by centromere detachment from the SPB. Telomere clustering depends on the formation of the microtubule-organizing center at telomeres by the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton complex (LINC), while centromere detachment depends on disassembly of kinetochores, which induces meiotic centromere formation. However, how the switching of telomere and centromere positions occurs during bouquet formation is not fully understood. Here, we show that, when impaired telomere interaction with the LINC or microtubule disruption inhibited telomere clustering, kinetochore disassembly-dependent centromere detachment and accompanying meiotic centromere formation were also inhibited. Efficient centromere detachment required telomere clustering-dependent SPB recruitment of a conserved telomere component, Taz1, and microtubules. Furthermore, when artificial SPB recruitment of Taz1 induced centromere detachment in telomere clustering-defective cells, spindle formation was impaired. Thus, detachment of centromeres from the SPB without telomere clustering causes spindle impairment. These findings establish novel regulatory mechanisms, which prevent concurrent detachment of telomeres and centromeres from the SPB during bouquet formation and secure proper meiotic divisions.},

Gene disruption of nuf2+ in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe caused defects in chromosome segregation and the spindle checkpoint: the mitotic spindle elongated without segregating the chromosomes, indicating that spindle function was compromised, but that this abnormality did not result in metaphase arrest. Certain nuf2 temperature-sensitive mutations, however, caused metaphase arrest with condensed chromosomes and a short spindle, indicating that, while these mutations caused abnormalities in spindle function, the spindle checkpoint pathway remained intact. Metaphase arrest in these cells was dependent on the spindle checkpoint component Mad2. Interestingly, Nuf2 disappeared from the centromere during meiotic prophase when centromeres lose their connection to the spindle pole body. We propose that Nuf2 acts at the centromere to establish a connection with the spindle for proper chromosome segregation, and that Nuf2 function is also required for the spindle checkpoint.},

In the absence of centrosomes, the nature of the chromosome-based signal that recruits microtubules to promote spindle assembly as well as how spindle bipolarity is established and the chromosomes orient correctly toward the poles is not known. To address these questions, we focused on the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC). We have found that the CPC localizes in a ring around the meiotic chromosomes that is aligned with the axis of the spindle at all stages. Using new methods that dramatically increase the effectiveness of RNA interference in the germline, we show that the CPC interacts with Drosophila oocyte chromosomes and is required for the assembly of spindle microtubules. Furthermore, chromosome biorientation and the localization of the central spindle kinesin-6 protein Subito, which is required for spindle bipolarity, depend on the CPC components Aurora B and Incenp. Based on these data we propose that the ring of CPC around the chromosomes regulates multiple aspects of meiotic cell division including spindle assembly, the establishment of bipolarity, the recruitment of important spindle organization factors, and the biorientation of homologous chromosomes. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Genetics Society of America.},

The crystal structure shows that Poz1 employs two different binding surfaces to interact with Tpz1 and Rap1. Unexpectedly, the structure also reveals that Poz1 adopts a dimeric conformation. Mutational analyses suggest that proper interactions between Tpz1, Poz1, and Rap1 in the shelterin core complex are required for telomere length homeostasis and heterochromatin structure maintenance at telomeres.

The sex chromosome pairing sites in females are also heterochromatic, but involve different repeated sequences. In males, weak pairing sites are widely distributed along euchromatin but not heterochromatin of chromosome 2, an autosome. One strong site for male meiotic pairing has been identified on chromosome 2; it overlaps with the his locus, which contains the repetitive structural genes for the histones. In females the sites for pairing of chromosome 4, another autosome, are restricted to the heterochromatin. Thus for both sex chromosomes and autosomes, sites for achiasmatic pairing are heterochromatic in females but euchromatic (except for the rDNA) in males.

abstract = {The centrosome plays an essential role in maintaining genetic stability, ciliogenesis and cell polarisation. The core of the centrosome is made up of two centrioles that duplicate precisely once during every cell cycle to generate two centrosomes that are required for bipolar spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. Abundance of centriole proteins at optimal levels and their recruitment to the centrosome are tightly regulated in time and space in order to restrict aberrant duplication of centrioles, a phenomenon that is observed in many cancers. Recent advances have conclusively shown that dedicated ubiquitin ligase-dependent protein degradation machineries are involved in governing centriole duplication. These studies revealed intricate mechanistic insights into how the ubiquitin ligases target different centriole proteins. In certain cases, a specific ubiquitin ligase targets a number of substrate proteins that co-regulate centriole assembly, prompting the possibility that substrate-targeting occurs during formation of the sub-centriolar structures. There are also instances where a specific centriole duplication protein is targeted by several ubiquitin ligases at different stages of the cell cycle, suggesting synchronised actions. Recent evidence also indicated a direct association of E3 ubiquitin ligase with the centrioles, supporting the notion that substrate-targeting occurs in the organelle itself. In this review, we highlight these advances by underlining the mechanisms of how different ubiquitin ligase machineries control centriole duplication and discuss our views on their coordination.},

abstract = {The GTPase Ran has recently been shown to stimulate microtubule polymerization in mitotic extracts, but its mode of action is not understood. Here we show that the mitotic role of Ran is largely mediated by the nuclear transport factor importin $\beta$. Importin $\beta$ inhibits spindle formation in vitro and in vivo and sequesters an aster promoting activity (APA) that consists of multiple, independent factors. One component of APA is the microtubule-associated protein NuMA. NuMA and other APA components are discharged from importin $\beta$ by RanGTP and induce spindle-like structures in the absence of centrosomes, chromatin, or Ran. We propose that RanGTP functions in mitosis as in interphase by locally releasing cargoes from transport factors. In mitosis, this promotes spindle assembly by organizing microtubules in the vicinity of chromosomes.},

The size of the fission yeast $\gamma$-tubulin complex is large ( > 2000 kDa), comparable to that in metazoans. Both Alp4 and Alp6 localize to the spindle pole body (SPB) and also to the equatorial MTOC. Temperature-sensitive (ts) alp4 and alp6 mutants show two types of microtubular defects. First, monopolar mitotic spindles form. Secondly, abnormally long cytoplasmic microtubules appear that do not stop at the cell tips and are still associated with the SPB. Alp4 function is required in G 1 phase and ts mutants become lethal before S-phase. alp4 and alp6 mutants are hypersensitive to the microtubuledestabilizing drug thiabendazole (TBZ) and show a lethal 'cut' phenotype in its presence. Furthermore, alp4mad2 double mutants show an exaggerated multiple septation phenotype in TBZ.

The transition from meiosis to embryonic mitosis involves a necessary adaptation to integrate the dominant chromosome-dependent pathway with the centrosomes to form the bipolar spindle. Here, we took advantage of the Xenopus laevis egg extract system to mimic in vitro the assembly of the first embryonic spindle and investigate the respective contributions of the centrosome and the chromosomedependent pathway to the kinetics of the spindle bipolarization. We found that centrosomes control the transition from the meiotic to the mitotic spindle assembly mechanism.

abstract = {Prometaphase kinetochores interact with spindle microtubules (MTs) to establish chromosome bi-orientation. Before becoming bi-oriented, chromosomes frequently exhibit poleward movements (P-movements), which are commonly attributed to minus end-directed, MT-dependent motors. In fission yeast there are three such motors: dynein and two kinesin-14s, Pkl1p and Klp2p. None of these enzymes is essential for viability, and even the triple deletion grows well. This might be due to the fact that yeasts kinetochores are normally juxtapolar at mitosis onset, removing the need for poleward chromosome movement during prometaphase. Anaphase P-movement might also be dispensable in a spindle that elongates significantly. To test this supposition, we have analyzed kinetochore dynamics in cells whose kinetochore-pole connections have been dispersed. In cells recovering from this condition, the maximum rate of poleward kinetochore movement was unaffected by the deletion of any or all of these motors, strongly suggesting that other factors, like MT depolymerization, can cause such movements in vivo. However, Klp2p, which localizes to kinetochores, contributed to the effectiveness of P-movement by promoting the shortening of kinetochore fibers. {\textcopyright} 2006 European Molecular Biology Organization | All Rights Reserved.},

Kinetochore fibers (K-fibers) were frequently observed forming in association with chromosomes both during monastrol treatment and after monastrol removal. Surprisingly, these K-fibers were oriented away from, and not directly connected to, centrosomes and incorporated into the spindle by the sliding of their distal ends toward centrosomes via a NuMA-dependent mechanism. Similar preformed K-fibers were also observed during spindle formation in untreated cells. In addition, upon monastrol removal, centrosomes established a transient chromosome-free bipolar array whose orientation specified the axis along which chromosomes segregated. We propose that the capture and incorporation of preformed K-fibers complements the microtubule plus-end capture mechanism and contributes to spindle formation in vertebrates.},

During this process, a multilayer proteinaceous structure called a synaptonemal complex (SC) is formed in many eukaryotes. However, in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, linear elements (LinEs), which are structures related to axial elements of the SC, form on the meiotic cohesin-based chromosome axis. The structure of LinEs has been observed using silver-stained electron micrographs or in immunofluorescence-stained spread nuclei. However, the fine structure of LinEs and their dynamics in intact living cells remain to be elucidated. In this study, we performed live cell imaging with wide-field fluorescence microscopy as well as 3D structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) of the core components of LinEs (Rec10, Rec25, Rec27, Mug20) and a linE-binding protein Hop1. We found that LinEs form along the chromosome axis and elongate during meiotic prophase. 3D-SIM microscopy revealed that Rec10 localized to meiotic chromosomes in the absence of other LinE proteins, but shaped into LinEs only in the presence of all three other components, the Rec25, Rec27, and Mug20. Elongation of LinEs was impaired in double-strand break-defective rec12− cells. The structure of LinEs persisted after treatment with 1,6-hexanediol and showed slow fluorescence recovery from photobleaching. These results indicate that LinEs are stable structures resembling axial elements of the SC.},

However, the relative role of these pathways is not well defined. Here we review the studies on spindle formation in Drosophila centrosome-containing cells. Mutants with impaired centrosome function assemble functional anastral spindles in somatic tissues and survive to adulthood. In contrast, mutants defective in chromosome-driven MT formation form highly aberrant mitotic spindles and die at larval stages. The requirements for spindle assembly in Drosophila male meiotic cells are diametrically opposed to those of somatic cells. Spermatocytes assemble morphologically normal spindles in the complete absence of chromosome-induced MTs, but are unable to organize a functional spindle in the absence of centrosomal MTs. Male meiotic spindles are much larger than mitotic spindles as they contain most of the tubulin needed for sperm tail formation. We suggest that the centrosome-based mechanism of spindle assembly in spermatocytes reflects their need for rapid and efficient polymerization of a particularly large amount of tubulin. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The spindle pole-to-pole distance remains constant from metaphase to anaphase A. We show that fission yeast sister centromere-connecting proteins, Mis6 and Mis12, are required for correct spindle morphogenesis, determining metaphase spindle length. Thirty-five to sixty percent extension of metaphase spindle length takes place in mis6 and mis12 mutants. This may be due to incorrect spindle morphogenesis containing impaired sister centromeres or force unbalance between pulling by the linked sister kinetochores and kinetochore-independent pushing. The mutant spindle fully extends in anaphase, although it is accompanied by drastic missegregation by aberrant sister centromere separation. Hence, metaphase spindle length may be crucial for segregation fidelity. Suppressors of mis12 partly restore normal metaphase spindle length. In mis4 that is defective in sister chromatid cohesion, metaphase spindle length is also long, but anaphase spindle extension is blocked, probably due to the activated spindle checkpoint. Extensive missegregation is caused in mis12 only when Mis12 is inactivated from the previous M through to the following M, an effective way to avoid missegregation in the cell cycle. Mis12 has conserved homologs in budding yeast and filamentous fungi.},

Recently, it was uncovered that MTs nucleate from preexisting MTs within the mitotic spindle, which requires the protein TPX2, but the mechanism basis for TPX2 action is unknown. Here, we investigate the role of TPX2 in branching MT nucleation. We establish the domain organization of Xenopus laevis TPX2 and define the minimal TPX2 version that stimulates branching MT nucleation, which we find is unrelated to TPX2's ability to nucleate MTs in vitro. Several domains of TPX2 contribute to its MT-binding and bundling activities. However, the property necessary for TPX2 to induce branching MT nucleation is contained within newly identified $\gamma$-TuRC nucleation activator motifs. Separation-of-function mutations leave the binding of TPX2 to $\gamma$-TuRC intact, whereas branching MT nucleation is abolished, suggesting that TPX2 may activate $\gamma$-TuRC to promote branching MT nucleation.},

abstract = {(Table presented.). Summary: Cytoskeletal microtubules (MTs) have a multitude of functions including intracellular distribution of molecules and organelles, cell morphogenesis, as well as segregation of the genetic material and separation of the cytoplasm during cell division among eukaryotic organisms. In response to internal and external cues, eukaryotic cells remodel their MT network in a regulated manner in order to assemble physiologically important arrays for cell growth, cell proliferation, or for cells to cope with biotic or abiotic stresses. Nucleation of new MTs is a critical step for MT remodeling. Although many key factors contributing to MT nucleation and organization are well conserved in different kingdoms, the centrosome, representing the most prominent microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs), disappeared during plant evolution as angiosperms lack the structure. Instead, flexible MTOCs may emerge on the plasma membrane, the nuclear envelope, and even organelles depending on types of cells and organisms and/or physiological conditions. MT-dependent MT nucleation is particularly noticeable in plant cells because it accounts for the primary source of MT generation for assembling spindle, phragmoplast, and cortical arrays when the $\gamma$-tubulin ring complex is anchored and activated by the augmin complex. It is intriguing what proteins are associated with plant-specific MTOCs and how plant cells activate or inactivate MT nucleation activities in spatiotemporally regulated manners.},

abstract = {Background The $\gamma$-tubulin ring complex ($\gamma$TuRC) is a multisubunit complex responsible for microtubule (MT) nucleation in eukaryotic cells. During mitosis, its spatial and temporal regulation promotes MT nucleation through different pathways. One of them is triggered around the chromosomes by RanGTP. Chromosomal MTs are essential for functional spindle assembly, but the mechanism by which RanGTP activates MT nucleation has not yet been resolved. Results We used a combination of Xenopus egg extracts and in vitro experiments to dissect the mechanism by which RanGTP triggers MT nucleation. In egg extracts, NEDD1-coated beads promote MT nucleation only in the presence of RanGTP. We show that RanGTP promotes a direct interaction between one of its targets, TPX2, and XRHAMM that defines a specific $\gamma$TuRC subcomplex. Through depletion/add-back experiments using mutant forms of TPX2 and NEDD1, we show that the activation of MT nucleation by RanGTP requires both NEDD1 phosphorylation on S405 by the TPX2-activated Aurora A and the recruitment of the complex through a TPX2-dependent mechanism. Conclusions The XRHAMM-$\gamma$TuRC complex is the target for activation by RanGTP that promotes an interaction between TPX2 and XRHAMM. The resulting TPX2-RHAMM-$\gamma$TuRC supracomplex fulfills the two essential requirements for the activation of MT nucleation by RanGTP: NEDD1 phosphorylation on S405 by the TPX2-activated Aurora A and the recruitment of the complex onto a TPX2-dependent scaffold. Our data identify TPX2 as the only direct RanGTP target and NEDD1 as the only Aurora A substrate essential for the activation of the RanGTP-dependent MT nucleation pathway.},

Here, we chart the more recent acquisition of a molecular understanding of centrosome structure and function. The strategies for gaining such knowledge were quickly developed in the yeasts to decipher the structure and function of their distinctive spindle pole bodies. Only within the past decade have studies with model eukaryotes and cultured cells brought a similar degree of sophistication to our understanding of the centrosome duplication cycle and the multiple roles of this organelle and its component parts in cell division and signaling. Now as we begin to understand these functions in the context of development, the way is being opened up for studies of the roles of centrosomes in human disease.},

Chromosome dynamics of prophase I have been studied in budding and fission yeasts, but little is known about this process in higher eukaryotes, where genomes and chromosomes are much larger and meiosis takes a longer time to complete. This knowledge gap has been mainly caused by difficulties in culturing isolated live meiocytes of multicellular eukaryotes. To study the nuclear dynamics during meiotic prophase in maize, we established a system to observe live meiocytes inside intact anthers.We found that maize chromosomes exhibited extremely dynamic and complex motility in zygonema and pachynema. The movement patterns differed dramatically between the two stages. Chromosome movements included rotations of the entire chromatin and movements of individual chromosome segments, which were mostly telomere-led. Chromosome motility was coincident with dynamic deformations of the nuclear envelope. Both, chromosome and nuclear envelope motility depended on actin microfilaments as well as tubulin. The complexity of the nuclear movements implies that several different mechanisms affect chromosome motility in early meiotic prophase in maize. We propose that the vigorous nuclear motility provides a mechanism for homologous loci to find each other during zygonema.},

abstract = {During oogenesis, two successive meiotic cell divisions occur without functional centrosomes because of the inactivation and subsequent elimination of maternal centrosomes during the diplotene stage of meiosis I. Despite being a conserved phenomenon in most metazoans, the means by which this centrosome behavior is controlled during female meiosis remain elusive. Here, we conducted a targeted RNAi screening in the Caenorhabditis elegans gonad to identify novel regulators of centrosome behavior during oogenesis. We screened 513 genes known to be essential for embryo production and directly visualized GFP-$\gamma$-Tubulin to monitor centrosome behavior at all stages of oogenesis. In the screening, we found that RNAi-mediated inactivation of 33 genes delayed the elimination of GFP-$\gamma$-Tubulin at centrosomes during oogenesis, whereas inactivation of nine genes accelerated the process. Depletion of the TRIM-NHL protein LIN-41 led to a significant delay in centrosome elimination and to the separation and reactivation of centrosomes during oogenesis. Upon LIN-41 depletion, meiotic chromosomes were abnormally condensed and pulled toward one of the two spindle poles around late pachytene even though the spindle microtubules emanated from both centrosomes. Overall, our work provides new insights into the regulation of centrosome behavior to ensure critical meiotic events and the generation of intact oocytes.},

Ndj1p interacts with Mps3p, a nuclear envelope SUN domain protein that is required for spindle pole body duplication and for sister chromatid cohesion. Removal of the Ndj1p-interaction domain from MPS3 creates an ndj1$\Delta$-like separation-of-function allele, and Ndj1p and Mps3p are codependent for stable association with the telomeres.

To assess the nature and stringency of constraints on human recombination, we examined crossover patterns in transmissions to viable, non-trisomic offspring, using dense genotyping data collected in a large set of pedigrees. Our analysis supports a requirement for one chiasma per chromosome rather than per arm to ensure proper disjunction, with additional chiasmata occurring in proportion to physical length. The requirement is not absolute, however, as chromosome 21 seems to be frequently transmitted properly in the absence of a chiasma in females, a finding that raises the possibility of a back-up mechanism aiding in its correct segregation. We also found a set of double crossovers in surprisingly close proximity, as expected from a second pathway that is not subject to crossover interference. These findings point to multiple mechanisms that shape the distribution of crossovers, influencing proper disjunction in humans. {\textcopyright} 2009 Fledel-Alon et al.},

abstract = {Bouquet formation, in which telomeres gather to a small region of the nuclear membrane in early meiosis, has been observed in diverse eukaryotes, but the function of the bouquet has remained a mystery. Here, we demonstrate that the telomere bouquet plays a crucial role in controlling the behavior of the fission yeast microtubule-organizing center (known as the spindle pole body or SPB) and the meiotic spindle. Using mutations that specifically disrupt the bouquet, we analyze chromosome, SPB, and spindle dynamics throughout meiosis. If the bouquet fails to form, the SPB becomes fragmented at meiosis I, leading to monopolar, multiple, and mislocalized spindles. Correct SPB and spindle behavior require not only the SPB recruitment of telomere proteins but also that the proteins are properly bound to telomeric DNA. This discovery illuminates an unanticipated level of communication between chromosomes and the spindle apparatus that may be widely conserved among eukaryotes. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Bouquet formation is hypothesized to facilitate homologous chromosome pairing. In fission yeast, bouquet formation and telomere clustering occurs in karyogamy and persists throughout the horsetail stage. Here we report the isolation and characterization of six mutants from our screen for meiotic mutants. These mutants show defective telomere clustering as demonstrated by mislocalization of Swi6::GFP, a heterochromatin-binding protein, and Tazlp::GFP, a telomere-specific protein. These mutants define four complementation groups and are named dot1 to dot4-defective organization of telomeres, dot3 and dot4 are allelic to mar1-Mm and mei4, respectively. Immunolocalization of Sad1, a protein associated with the spindle pole body (SPB), in dot mutants showed an elevated frequency of multiple Sad1-nuclei signals relative to wild type. Many of these Sad1 foci were colocalized with Tazl::GFP. Impaired SPB structure and function were further demonstrated by failure of spore wall formation in dot1, by multiple Pcp1::GFP signals (an SPB component) in dot2, and by abnormal microtubule organizations during meiosis in dot mutants. The coincidence of impaired SPB functions with defective telomere clustering suggests a link between the SPB and the telomere cluster.},

In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the mitosis and the first meiotic division (MI) are “closed,” during which the NE is maintained. Intriguingly, during the second meiotic division (MII), the NE is also maintained, but nuclear and cytoplasmic molecules are mixed similarly to open mitosis, a phenomenon of unknown biological significance called “virtual” NEBD (vNEBD). Here, we show that importin-$\alpha$-dependent nucleocytoplasmic transport regulates spindle disassembly late in anaphase B at MI, as previously reported for mitosis. At MII, however, spindle dissolution is triggered by vNEBD early in anaphase B, a mechanism that short-circuits the nucleocytoplasmic transport system. We demonstrate that the sequential action of these two spindle disassembly systems regulates the spatiotemporal order and ploidy of the meiotic products. vNEBD is a phenomenon described in the fission yeast second meiotic division (MII), which resembles the nuclear envelope breakdown that characterizes the mitotic phase in eukaryotes.

Centrosomes nucleate the growth of microtubules and orchestrate the efficient assembly of the mitotic spindle. Recent studies in vivo and in vitro have shown that the spindle can form even in the absence of centrosomes and demonstrate that individual cells can divide without this organelle [1-8]. However, since centrosomes are involved in multiple processes in vivo, including polarized cell divisions, which are an essential developmental mechanism for producing differentiated cell types [9, 10], it remains to be shown whether or not a complete organism can develop without centrosomes. Here we show that in Drosophila a centrosomin (cnn) null mutant, which fails to assemble fully functional mitotic centrosomes and has few or no detectable astral microtubules, can develop into an adult fly. These results challenge long-held assumptions that the centrosome and the astral microtubules emanating from it are essential for development and are required specifically for spindle orientation during asymmetric cell divisions.},

Crossovers increase genetic diversity but their main function is to ensure accurate chromosome segregation. Defects in crossover number and position produce aneuploidies that represent the main cause of miscarriages and chromosomal abnormalities such as Down's syndrome. Recombination is initiated by the formation of programmed double strand breaks (DSBs), which occur preferentially at places called DSB hotspots. Among all DSBs generated, only a small fraction is repaired by crossover, the other being repaired by other homologous recombination pathways. Crossover maps have been generated in a number of organisms, defining crossover hotspots. With the availability of genome-wide maps of DSBs as well as the ability to measure genetically the repair outcome at several hotspots, it is becoming more and more clear that not all DSB hotspots behave the same for crossover formation, suggesting that chromosomal features distinguish different types of hotspots. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

Both Csi1 and Sad1 mutants exhibited centromere clustering defects in a high percentage of cells. Csi1 mutants also displayed a high rate of chromosome loss during mitosis, significant mitotic delays, and sensitivity to perturbations in microtubule-kinetochore interactions and chromosome numbers.

abstract = {Centrosomes act as major microtubule-organizing centers in most cell types. Their functions in interphase and mitosis are usually facilitated by their association with the nucleus. This may be particularly true in very large cells. Several papers report free centrosomes in syncytial Drosophila embryos. However, this phenotype often remains little explored. Yet, free centrosomes can occur by multiple mechanisms, including functional defects of the mitotic spindle, detachment of centrosomes from the nuclear envelope, centrosome inactivation upon DNA damage, and de novo centrosome genesis. Deciphering the cellular mechanism leading to free centrosomes upon a given perturbation such as a mutation or injection of a drug, can provide valuable clues regarding the nature of the molecular pathway affected. To this end, genetic and cytological tests, as well as time-lapse imaging are available. These studies can inform on the biology of centrosomes, cell cycle regulation and cytoskeletal dynamics. Here we briefly discuss what to make of free centrosomes in the fly embryo. {\textcopyright} 2010 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract = {The existence of two forms of the chromosome passenger complex (CPC) in the mammalian oocyte has meant that its role in female meiosis has remained unclear. Here we use loss- and gain-of function approaches to assess the meiotic functions of one of the shared components of these complexes, INCENP, and of the variable kinase subunits, Aurora B or Aurora C. We show that either the depletion of INCENP or the combined inhibition of Aurora kinases B and C activates the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) before chromosomes have properly congressed in meiosis I and also prevents cytokinesis and hence extrusion of the first polar body. Overexpression of Aurora C also advances APC/C activation and results in cytokinesis failure in a high proportion of oocytes, indicative of a dominant effect on CPC function. Together, this points to roles for the meiotic CPC in functions similar to the mitotic roles of the complex: correcting chromosome attachment to microtubules, facilitating the spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC) function and enabling cytokinesis. Surprisingly, overexpression of Aurora B leads to a failure of APC/C activation, stabilization of securin and consequently a failure of chiasmate chromosomes to resolve - a dominant phenotype that is completely suppressed by depletion of INCENP. Taken together with the differential distribution of Aurora proteins B and C on chiasmate chromosomes, this points to differential functions of the two forms of CPC in regulating the separation of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I.},

Recent studies have revealed the crucial roles played by morphologically distinct cytoplasmic microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) in initiating spindle bipolarity and maintaining spindle orientation robustness. These MTOCs resemble centrosomes in many aspects, implying an evolutionary divergence of MT-organizing structures in plants. However, their functions rely on conserved nucleation and amplification mechanisms, indicating a similarity in MT network establishment between animals and plants. Moreover, recent characterization of a plant-specific MT minus-end tracking protein suggests that plants have developed functionally equivalent modules to stabilize and organize MTs at minus ends. These findings support the theory that plants overcome centrosome loss by utilizing modified but substantially conserved mechanisms to organize MT networks.},

Much less developed is our understanding of another facet of centrosomes and SPBs, namely their possible role as signalling centres. Yet, many signalling components, including kinases and phosphatases, have been associated with centrosomes and spindle poles, giving rise to the hypothesis that these organelles might serve as hubs for the integration and coordination of signalling pathways. In this review, we discuss a number of selected studies that bear on this notion. We cover different processes (cell cycle control, development, DNA damage response) and organisms (yeast, invertebrates and vertebrates), but have made no attempt to be comprehensive. This field is still young and although the concept of centrosomes and SPBs as signalling centres is attractive, it remains primarily a concept-in need of further scrutiny.

Our results reaffirm the existence of a common high efficiency in the pairing process leading to the obtainment of a bivalent for all chromosomes studied in euploid and aneuploid cases. Nevertheless, this high efficiency was insufficient to consistently produce trivalents in aneuploid oocytes. Trivalent 21 was only observed in 48.8% of the 47,XX, + 21 pachytene-stage oocytes studied, and trivalent 13 was found in 68.7% of the 47,XX, + 13 pachytene-stage oocytes analyzed. Our data confirm the hypothesis which suggests that in human oocytes the presence of an extra chromosome could interfere in bouquet dynamics. In addition, the pairing process of the X chromosome is altered in trisomic 21 oocytes, providing evidence of the influence that an extra chromosome 21 may cause meiotic progression. {\textcopyright} 2007 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.},

Here, we use live-cell imaging with fluorescent probes and F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors to monitor the changes in Ran and importin $\beta$ signaling induced by perturbations of Ran in mouse oocytes while examining the MI spindle dynamics. We show that unlike RanT24N employed in previous studies, a RanT24N, T42A double mutant inhibits RanGEF without perturbing cargo binding to importin $\beta$ and disrupts MI spindle function in chromosome segregation. Roles of Ran and importin $\beta$ in the coalescence of microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) and MI spindle assembly are further supported by the use of the chemical inhibitor importazole, whose effects are partially rescued by the GTP hydrolysis-resistant RanQ69L mutant. These results indicate that RanGTP is essential for MI spindle assembly and function both in humans and mice.},

This overly simplistic view has come under challenge since discovering that the human spermatozoon provides a second, atypical centriole to the zygote. The study of human zygotes is challenging for ethical reasons, and bovine zygotes provide an important model due to a similarity in centrosome embryonic inherence and function. Detailed ultrastructural analyses by Uzbekov and colleagues identify the persistence of atypical centrioles in bovine early embryos, raising questions about the original single-centriole model. Whether the parental origin of nascent atypical centrioles or their wide structural diversity and deviation from the canonical centriolar form in blastomeres constitutes sufficient evidence to warrant a reconsideration of the single-centriole model is discussed herein. Because previous human studies identified only one canonical centriole in the zygote, atypical centrioles are likely present in the early human embryo; therefore, it is time to rethink the role of paternal centrioles in human development.},

In C. elegans, homolog pairing and synapsis depend on pairing centers (PCs), special regions near one end of each chromosome that interact with the nuclear envelope (NE) and cytoplasmic microtubules. Here, we report that PCs are required for nuclear reorganization at the onset of meiosis. We demonstrate that PCs recruit the Polo-like kinase PLK-2 to induce NE remodeling, chromosome pairing, and synapsis. Recruitment of PLK-2 is also required to mediate a cell cycle delay and selective apoptosis of nuclei containing unsynapsed chromosomes, establishing a molecular link between these two quality control mechanisms.

This dual mechanism hypothesis predicts different hybrid DNA patterns in noncrossover and crossover recombinants. We show that these predictions are not upheld, by mapping with unprecedented resolution parental strand contributions to recombinants at a model locus. Instead, break repair in both noncrossovers and crossovers involves synthesis-dependent strand annealing, often with multiple rounds of strand invasion. Crossover-specific double Holliday junction formation occurs via processes involving branch migration as an integral feature, one that can be separated from repair of the break itself. These findings reveal meiotic recombination to be a highly dynamic process and prompt a new view of the relationship between crossover and noncrossover recombination.},

The question remains, however, whether this pathway only activates when centrosome activity is compromised, or whether it contributes to spindle morphogenesis during a normal mitosis. Here, we show that many of the kinetochore fibers (K-fibers) in centrosomal Drosophila 52 cells are formed by the kinetochores. Initially, kinetochore-formed K-fibers are not oriented toward a spindle pole but, as they grow, their minus ends are captured by astral microtubules (MTs) and transported poleward through a dynein-dependent mechanism. This poleward transport results in chromosome bi-orientation and congression. Furthermore, when individual K-fibers are severed by laser microsurgery, they regrow from the kinetochore outward via MT plus-end polymerization at the kinetochore. Thus, even in the presence of centrosomes, the formation of some K-fibers is initiated by the kinetochores. However, centrosomes facilitate the proper orientation of K-fibers toward spindle poles by integrating them into a common spindle.},

abstract = {During meiosis, each chromosome must selectively pair and synapse with its own unique homolog to enable crossover formation and subsequent segregation. How homolog pairing is maintained in early meiosis to ensure synapsis occurs exclusively between homologs is unknown. We aimed to further understand this process by examining the meiotic defects of a unique Drosophila mutant, Mcm5A7. We found that Mcm5A7 mutants are proficient in homolog pairing at meiotic onset yet fail to maintain pairing as meiotic synapsis ensues, causing seemingly normal synapsis between non-homologous loci. This pairing defect corresponds with a reduction of SMC1-dependent centromere clustering at meiotic onset. Overexpressing SMC1 in this mutant significantly restores centromere clustering, homolog pairing, and crossover formation. These data indicate that the initial meiotic pairing of homologs is not sufficient to yield synapsis exclusively between homologs and provide a model in which meiotic homolog pairing must be stabilized by centromeric SMC1 to ensure proper synapsis.},

Using this mutant we show for the first time that AURKC has functions that do not overlap with AURKB. These functions include regulating localized CPC activity and regulating chromosome alignment and K-MT attachments at metaphase of meiosis I (Met I). We find that AURKC-CPC is not the sole CPC complex that regulates the spindle assembly checkpoint in meiosis, and as a result most AURKC-perturbed oocytes arrest at Met I. A small subset of oocytes do proceed through cytokinesis normally, suggesting that AURKC-CPC is not the sole CPC complex during telophase I. But, the resulting eggs are aneuploid, indicating that AURKC is a critical regulator of meiotic chromosome segregation in female gametes. Taken together, these data suggest that mammalian oocytes contain AURKC to efficiently execute meiosis I and ensure high-quality eggs necessary for sexual reproduction. {\textcopyright} 2014 Balboula, Schindler.},

abstract = {Mammalian oocytes assemble a bipolar acentriolar microtubule spindle to segregate chromosomes during asymmetric division. There is increasing evidence that actin in the spindle interior not only participates in spindle migration and positioning but also protects oocytes from chromosome segregation errors leading to aneuploidy. Here we show that actin is an integral component of the meiotic machinery that closely interacts with microtubules during all major events of human oocyte maturation from the time point of spindle assembly till polar body extrusion and metaphase arrest. With the aid of drugs selectively affecting cytoskeleton dynamics and transiently disturbing the integrity of the two cytoskeleton systems, we identify interdependent structural rearrangements indicative of a close communication between actin and microtubules as fundamental feature of human oocytes. Our data support a model of actin-microtubule interplay that is essential for bipolar spindle assembly and correct partitioning of the nuclear genome in human oocyte meiosis.},

abstract = {Foetal ovarian tissue is now being cultured or frozen, to generate oocytes for assisted reproduction, an emerging technology. This study examines the ultrastructure of oogonia at 13-15 weeks of gestation, which could be used as a control for culture and freezing of foetal ovaries. Oogonia are largely located in the ovarian cortex, whilst primordial germ cells (PGC) and somatic follicle cells compose the surface epithelium. Oogonia and PGC have large vesicular nuclei with clear cytoplasm, compared to dense follicle cells, which have polymorphic nuclei. Follicle cells intermingle with oogonia and establish close contacts - beginning of folliculogenesis. Nuclei of oogonia contain one to three highly reticulated nucleoli, reflecting high levels of RNA synthesis at the onset of growth. Rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) form stacks of cisternae associated with numerous ribosomes. Prominent organelles in the ooplasm are elongated mitochondria with dense matrices and tubular cristate presenting a multilocular appearance. Typical Golgi complexes, dense bodies and clear vacuoles are present and microfilaments are located beneath the plasma membrane. The most remarkable feature of oogonia is that they have typical juxtanuclear centrioles (diplosomes) with dense pericentriolar material, which nucleate microtubules, characteristic of functional centrosomes organizing the cytoskeleton. The mature oocyte has no centrioles, since the maternal centrosome is inactivated or reduced, while the paternal is dominant. Centrioles are most likely involved in mitosis of oogonia.

Further analysis by in situ hybridization revealed that the telomeres remain clustered at the leading end of premeiotic chromosome movement, unlike mitotic chromosome movement in which the centromere leads. Once meiotic chromosome segregation starts, however, centromeres resume the leading position in chromosome movement, as they do in mitosis. Although the movement of the telomere first has not been observed before, the clustering of telomeres is reminiscent of the bouquet structure of meiotic-prophase chromosomes observed in higher eukaryotes, which suggests that telomeres perform specific functions required for premeiotic chromosomal events generally in eukaryotes.},

In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the existence of such a cell-cycle checkpoint has been proposed to delay the metaphase to anaphase transition when spindle poles are not properly oriented with respect to the actomyosin ring1. Here we show, by using a fission yeast mutant compromised in its assembly of astral microtubules, that in the absence of astral microtubules short metaphase spindles are unable to orient themselves with respect to the long axis of the cell and are delayed in spindle elongation. This astral defect engages a spindle orientation checkpoint because deletion of the transcription factor Atf1, which is involved in maintaining this checkpoint, allows misaligned asterless metaphase spindles to elongate. We propose that astral microtubules are involved directly in monitoring orientation of the metaphase spindle and in controlling the timing of elongation in fission yeast.},

abstract = {Misregulation of the evolutionarily conserved GTPase Ran in fission yeast results in defects in several cellular processes in cells that are competent for nucleocytoplasmic protein transport. These results suggest that transport is neither the only nor the primary Ran-dependent process in living cells. The ability of Ran to independently regulate multiple cellular processes in vivo is demonstrated by showing that (i) eight different transport-competent RanGEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) mutants have defects in mitotic spindle formation; (ii) the RanGEF temperature-sensitive mutant pim1-d1 has abnormal actin ring structures at the septum. Overexpression of Imp2p, which specifically destabilizes these structures, restores viability. (iii) Ran-dependent processes differ in their requirements for active Ran in vivo. Microtubule function, cytokinesis, and nuclear envelope structure are the Ran-dependent processes most sensitive to the amount of Ran protein in the cell, whereas nucleocytoplasmic protein transport is the most robust. Therefore, the ability of Ran from Schizosaccharomyces pombe to independently regulate multiple cellular processes may reflect differences in its interactions with the binding proteins that mediate these functions and explain the complex phenotypic consequences of its misregulation in vivo.},

abstract = {In many organisms, telomeres cluster to form a bouquet arrangement of chromosomes during meiotic prophase. Previously, we reported that two meiotic proteins, Bqt1 and -2, are required for tethering telomeres to the spindle pole body (SPB) during meiotic prophase in fission yeast. This study has further identified two novel, ubiquitously expressed inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins, Bqt3 and -4, which are required for bouquet formation. We found that in the absence of Bqt4, telomeres failed to associate with the nuclear membranes in vegetative cells and consequently failed to cluster to the SPB in meiotic prophase. In the absence of Bqt3, Bqt4 protein was degraded during meiosis, leading to a phenotype similar to that of the bqt4-null mutant. Collectively, these results show that Bqt4 anchors telomeres to the INM and that Bqt3 protects Bqt4 from protein degradation. Interestingly, the functional integrity of telomeres is maintained even when they are separated from the nuclear envelope in vegetative cells. {\textcopyright} 2009 Chikashige et al.},

New studies hint that the centrosome functions in more than MTorganization.

This alone could have important implications for a renaissance in our understanding of the development of primary cilia, endosome recycling, and the immune response.

abstract = {Centrioles must be eliminated or inactivated from the oocyte to ensure that only the two functional centrioles contributed by the sperm are present in the zygote. Such removal can occur during oogenesis, as in Drosophila, where departure of Polo kinase from centrosomes leads to loss of microtubule nucleating activity and centriole removal. In other species, oocyte-derived centrioles are removed around the time of fertilization through incompletely understood mechanisms. Here, we use confocal imaging of live starfish oocytes and zygotes expressing markers of microtubule nucleating activity and centrioles to investigate this question. We first assay the role of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) in centriole elimination. We find that although Plk1 localizes around oocyte-derived centrioles, kinase impairment with BI-2536 does not protect centrioles from removal in the bat star Patiria miniata. Moreover, we uncover that all four oocyte-derived centrioles lose microtubule nucleating activity when retained experimentally in the zygote of the radiate star Asterias forbesi. Interestingly, two such centrioles nevertheless retain the centriolar markers mEGFP::PACT and pmPoc1::mEGFP. Together, these findings indicate that centrioles can persist when Plk1 activity is impaired, as well as when microtubule nucleating activity is lacking, uncovering further diversity in the mechanisms governing centriole removal.},

Here, we determine the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a central region of TPX2 bound to the MT surface. TPX2 uses two flexibly linked elements (‘ridge' and ‘wedge') in a novel interaction mode to simultaneously bind across longitudinal and lateral tubulin interfaces. These MT-interacting elements overlap with the binding site of importins on TPX2. Fluorescence microscopy-based in vitro reconstitution assays reveal that this interaction mode is critical for MT binding and facilitates MT nucleation. Together, our results suggest a molecular mechanism of how the Ran-GTP gradient can regulate TPX2-dependent MT formation.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {In many organisms, a synaptonemal complex (SC) intimately connects each pair of homologous chromosomes during much of the first meiotic prophase and is thought to play a role in regulating recombination. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the central element of each SC contains Zip1, a protein orthologous to mammalian SYCP1. To study the dynamics of SCs in living meiotic cells, a functional ZIP1::GFP fusion was introduced into yeast and analyzed by fluorescence video microscopy. During pachytene, SCs exhibited dramatic and continuous movement throughout the nucleus, traversing relatively large distances while twisting, folding, and unfolding. Chromosomal movements were accompanied by changes in the shape of the nucleus, and all movements were reversibly inhibited by the actin antagonist Latrunculin B. Normal movement required the NDJ1 gene, which encodes a meiosis-specific telomere protein needed for the attachment of telomeres to the nuclear periphery and for normal kinetics of recombination and meiosis. These results show that SC movements involve telomere attachment to the nuclear periphery and are actin-dependent and suggest these movements could facilitate completion of meiotic recombination. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

During meiotic prophase, telomeres transiently cluster at a limited sector of the nuclear envelope (bouquet stage) near the spindle pole body (SPB). Cohesin is a multisubunit complex that contributes to chromosome segregation in meiosis I and II divisions. In yeast meiosis, deficiency for Rec8 cohesin subunit induces telomere clustering to persist, whereas telomere cluster–SPB colocalization is defective. These defects are rescued by expressing the mitotic cohesin Scc1 in rec8$\Delta$ meiosis, whereas bouquet-stage exit is independent of Cdc5 pololike kinase. An analysis of living Saccharomyces cerevisiae meiocytes revealed highly mobile telomeres from leptotene up to pachytene, with telomeres experiencing an actin- but not microtubule-dependent constraint of mobility during the bouquet stage. Our results suggest that cohesin is required for exit from actin polymerization–dependent telomere clustering and for linking the SPB to the telomere cluster in synaptic meiosis.},

abstract = {The first cell of an animal (zygote) requires centrosomes that are assembled from paternally inherited centrioles and maternally inherited pericentriolar material (PCM) [1]. In some animals, sperm centrioles with typical ultrastructure are the origin of the first centrosomes in the zygote [2–4]. In other animals, however, sperm centrioles lose their proteins and are thought to be degenerated and non-functional during spermiogenesis [5, 6]. Here, we show that the two sperm centrioles (the giant centriole [GC] and the proximal centriole-like structure [PCL]) in Drosophila melanogaster are remodeled during spermiogenesis through protein enrichment and ultrastructure modification in parallel to previously described centrosomal reduction [7]. We found that the ultrastructure of the matured sperm (spermatozoa) centrioles is modified dramatically and that the PCL does not resemble a typical centriole. We also describe a new phenomenon of Poc1 enrichment of the atypical centrioles in the spermatozoa. Using various mutants, protein expression during spermiogenesis, and RNAi knockdown of paternal Poc1, we found that paternal Poc1 enrichment is essential for the formation of centrioles during spermiogenesis and for the formation of centrosomes after fertilization in the zygote. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that the sperm centrioles are remodeled both in their protein composition and in ultrastructure, yet they are functional and are essential for normal embryogenesis in Drosophila.},

abstract = {The chromosomes in the oocytes of many animals appear to promote bipolar spindle assembly. In Drosophila oocytes, spindle assembly requires the chromosome passenger complex (CPC), which consists of INCENP, Borealin, Survivin, and Aurora B. To determine what recruits the CPC to the chromosomes and its role in spindle assembly, we developed a strategy to manipulate the function and localization of INCENP, which is critical for recruiting the Aurora B kinase. We found that an interaction between Borealin and the chromatin is crucial for the recruitment of the CPC to the chromosomes and is sufficient to build kinetochores and recruit spindle microtubules. HP1 colocalizes with the CPC on the chromosomes and together they move to the spindle microtubules. We propose that the Borealin interaction with HP1 promotes the movement of the CPC from the chromosomes to the microtubules. In addition, within the central spindle, rather than at the centromeres, the CPC and HP1 are required for homologous chromosome bi-orientation.},

Indirect evidence has suggested that microtubules also might be nucleated from pre-existing microtubules throughout the spindle, but this process has not been observed directly. Here, we demonstrate microtubule nucleation from the sides of existing microtubules in meiotic Xenopus egg extracts. Daughter microtubules grow at a low branch angle and with the same polarity as mother filaments. Branching microtubule nucleation requires $\gamma$-tubulin and augmin and is stimulated by factors previously implicated in chromatin-stimulated nucleation, guanosine triphosphate(GTP)-bound Ran and its effector, TPX2. Because of the rapid amplification of microtubule numbers and the preservation of microtubule polarity, microtubule-dependent microtubule nucleation is well suited for spindle assembly and maintenance. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

In metaphase, chromosomes are aligned on the spindle with sister kinetochores facing toward the opposite poles. In anaphase A, sister chromatids separate from each other without spindle extension, whereas spindle elongation takes place during anaphase B. We have critically examined whether such mitotic stages also occur in a lower eukaryote, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Using the green fluorescent protein tagging technique, early mitotic to late anaphase events were observed in living fission yeast cells. S. pombe has three phases in spindle dynamics, spindle formation (phase 1), constant spindle length (phase 2), and spindle extension (phase 3). Sister centromere separation (anaphase A) rapidly occurred at the end of phase 2. The centromere showed dynamic movements throughout phase 2 as it moved back and forth and was transiently split in two before its separation, suggesting that the centromere was positioned in a bioriented manner toward the poles at metaphase. Microtubule-associating Dis1 was required for the occurrence of constant spindle length and centromere movement in phase 2. Normal transition from phase 2 to 3 needed DNA topoisomerase II and Cut1 but not Cut14. The duration of each phase was highly dependent on temperature.},

abstract = {The fine structure of human oogonia and growing oocytes has been reviewed in fetal and adult ovaries. Preovulatory maturation and the ultrastructure of stimulated oocytes from the germinal vesicle (GV) stage to metaphase II (MII) stage are also documented. Oogonia have large nuclei, scanty cytoplasm with complex mitochondria. During folliculogenesis, follicle cell processes establish desmosomes and deep gap junctions at the surface of growing oocytes, which are retracted during the final stages of maturation. The zona pellucida is secreted in secondary follicles. Growing oocytes have mitochondria, Golgi, rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), ribosomes, lysosomes, and lipofuscin bodies, often associated with Balbiani bodies and have nuclei with reticulated nucleoli. Oocytes from antral follicles show numerous surface microvilli and cortical granules (CGs) separated from the oolemma by a band of microfilaments. The CGs are evidently secreted by Golgi membranes. The GV oocytes have peripheral Golgi complexes associated with a single layer of CGs close to the oolemma. They have many lysosomes, and nuclei with dense compact nucleoli. GV breakdown occurs by disorganization of the nuclear envelope and the oocyte enters a transient metaphase I followed by MII, when it is arrested and ovulated. Maturation of oocytes in vitro follows the same pattern of meiosis seen in preovulatory oocytes. The general organization of the human oocyte conforms to that of most other mammals but has some unique features. The MII oocyte has the basic cellular organelles such as mitochondria, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, microfilaments, and microtubules, while Golgi, RER, lysosomes, multivesicular, residual and lipofuscin bodies are very rare. It neither has yolk nor lipid inclusions. Its surface has few microvilli, and 1-3 layers of CGs, aligned beneath the oolemma. Special reference has been made to the reduction and inactivation of the maternal centrosome during oogenesis. The MII spindle, often oriented perpendicular to the oocyte surface, is barrel-shaped, anastral and lacks centrioles. Osmiophilic centrosomes are not demonstrable in human eggs, since the maternal centrosome is nonfunctional. However, oogonia and growing oocytes have typical centrioles, similar to those of somatic cells. The sperm centrosome activates the egg and organizes the sperm aster and mitotic spindles of the embryo, after fertilization. {\textcopyright} 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

These findings strongly implicate Spo11 as the catalytic subunit of the meiotic DNA cleavage activity. This is the first identification of a biochemical function for any of the gene products involved in DSB formation. Spo11 defines a protein family with other members in fission yeast, nematodes, and archaebacteria. The S. pombe homolog, rec12p, is also known to be required for meiotic recombination.

abstract = {The pairing of homologous chromosomes and the intimate synapsis of the paired homologs by the synaptonemal complex (SC) are essential for subsequent meiotic processes including recombination and chromosome segregation. Here we show that the centromere clustering plays an important role in initiating homolog synapsis during meiosis in Drosophila females. Although centromeres are not clustered prior to the onset of meiosis, all four pairs of centromeres are actively clustered into one or two masses during early meiotic prophase. Within the 16-cell cyst, centromeric clustering appears to define the first step in the initiation of synapsis. Clustering is restricted to the nuclei that form the SC and is dependent on all known SC proteins. Surprisingly, both centromeric clusters and the SC components associated with them persist long after the disassembly of the euchromatic SC at the end of pachytene. The initiation of homologous recombination through the formation of programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) is not required for either the formation or the maintenance of the centromeric clusters. Our data support a view in which the SC-mediated clustering at the centromeres is the initiating event for meiotic synapsis. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The centrosome is the major microtubule organizing centre (MTOC) in animal cells. The canonical centrosome is composed of two centrioles surrounded by a pericentriolar matrix (PCM). In contrast, yeasts and amoebozoa have lost centrioles and possess acentriolar centrosomes—called the spindle pole body (SPB) and the nucleus-associated body (NAB), respectively. Despite the difference in their structures, centriolar centrosomes and SPBs not only share components but also common biogenesis regulators. In this review, we focus on the SPB and speculate how its structures evolved from the ancestral centrosome. Phylogenetic distribution of molecular components suggests that yeasts gained specific SPB components upon loss of centrioles but maintained PCM components associated with the structure. It is possible that the PCM structure remained even after centrosome remodelling due to its indispensable function to nucleate microtubules. We propose that the yeast SPB has been formed by a step-wise process; (1) an SPB-like precursor structure appeared on the ancestral centriolar centrosome; (2) it interacted with the PCM and the nuclear envelope; and (3) it replaced the roles of centrioles. Acentriolar centrosomes should continue to be a great model to understand how centrosomes evolved and how centrosome biogenesis is regulated.},

abstract = {In most animals, fertilized eggs inherit one centrosome from a meiosis-II spindle of oocytes and another centrosome from the sperm. However, since first proposed by Boveri [Sitzungsber. Ges. Morph. Phys. M{\"{u}}nch. 3 (1887) 151-164] at the turn of the last century, it has been believed that only the paternal (sperm) centrosome provides the division poles for mitosis in animal zygotes. This uniparental (paternal) inheritance of centrosomes is logically based on the premise that the maternal (egg) centrosome is lost before the onset of the first mitosis. For the processes of the selective loss of the maternal centrosome, three models have been proposed: One stresses the intrinsic factors within the centrosome itself; the other two emphasize external factors such as cytoplasmic conditions or the sperm centrosome. In the present study, we have examined the validity of one of the models in which the sperm centrosome overwhelms the maternal centrosomes. Because centrosomes cast off into both the first and the second polar bodies (PB) are known to retain the capacity for reproduction and cell-division pole formation, we observed the behavior of those PB centrosomes with reproductive capacity and the sperm centrosome in the same zygotic cytoplasm. We prepared two kinds of fertilized eggs that contain reproductive maternal centrosomes, (1) by micromanipulative transplantation of the PB centrosomes into fertilized eggs, and (2) by suppression of the PB extrusions of fertilized eggs with cytochalasin B. In both types of eggs, the PB centrosomes could double and form cell-division poles, indicating that they are not suppressed by the sperm centrosome, which in turn indicates that selective loss of the maternal centrosome is due to intrinsic factors within the centrosomes themselves. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The chiasma is a structure that forms between a pair of homologous chromosomes by crossover recombination and physically links the homologous chromosomes during meiosis. Chiasmata are essential for the attachment of the homologous chromosomes to opposite spindle poles (bipolar attachment) and their subsequent segregation to the opposite poles during meiosis I. However, the overall function of chiasmata during meiosis is not fully understood. Here, we show that chiasmata also play a crucial role in the attachment of sister chromatids to the same spindle pole and in their co-segregation during meiosis I in fission yeast. Analysis of cells lacking chiasmata and the cohesin protector Sgo1 showed that loss of chiasmata causes frequent bipolar attachment of sister chromatids during anaphase. Furthermore, high time-resolution analysis of centromere dynamics in various types of chiasmate and achiasmate cells, including those lacking the DNA replication checkpoint factor Mrc1 or the meiotic centromere protein Moa1, showed the following three outcomes: (i) during the pre-anaphase stage, the bipolar attachment of sister chromatids occurs irrespective of chiasma formation; (ii) the chiasma contributes to the elimination of the pre-anaphase bipolar attachment; and (iii) when the bipolar attachment remains during anaphase, the chiasmata generate a bias toward the proper pole during poleward chromosome pulling that results in appropriate chromosome segregation. Based on these results, we propose that chiasmata play a pivotal role in the selection of proper attachments and provide a backup mechanism that promotes correct chromosome segregation when improper attachments remain during anaphase I. {\textcopyright} 2011 Hirose et al.},

abstract = {In early mitosis, microtubules can be generated at kinetochores as well as at spindle poles. However, the role and regulation of kinetochore-derived microtubules have been unclear. In general, metaphase spindle microtubules are oriented such that their plus ends bind to kinetochores. However, we now have evidence that, during early mitosis in budding yeast, microtubules are generated at kinetochores with distal plus ends. These kinetochore-derived microtubules interact along their length with microtubules that extend from a spindle pole, facilitating kinetochore loading onto the lateral surface of spindle pole microtubules. Once kinetochores are loaded, microtubules are no longer generated at kinetochores, and those that remain disappear rapidly and do not contribute to the metaphase spindle. Stu2 (the ortholog of vertebrate XMAP215/ch-TOG) localizes to kinetochores and plays a central role in regulating kinetochore-derived microtubules. Our work provides insight into microtubule generation at kinetochores and the mechanisms that facilitate initial kinetochore interaction with spindle pole microtubules. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In meiosis, pairing and recombination of homologous chromosomes are crucial for the correct segregation of chromosomes, and substantial movements of chromosomes are required to achieve homolog pairing. During this process, it is known that telomeres cluster to form a bouquet arrangement of chromosomes. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe provides a striking example of bouquet formation, after which the entire nucleus oscillates between the cell poles (these oscillations are generally called horsetail nuclear movements) while the telomeres remain clustered to the spindle pole body (SPB; a centrosome-equivalent structure in fungi) at the leading edge of the moving nucleus. S. pombe mutants defective in telomere clustering frequently form aberrant spindles, such as monopolar or nonpolar spindles, leading to missegregation of the chromosomes at the subsequent meiotic divisions. Here we demonstrate that such defects in meiotic spindle formation caused by loss of meiotic telomere clustering are rescued when nuclear movement is prevented. On the other hand, stopping nuclear movement does not rescue defects in telomere clustering, nor chromosome missgregation even in cells that have formed a bipolar spindle. These results suggest that movement of the SPB without attachment of telomeres leads to the formation of aberrant spindles, but that recovering bipolar spindles is not sufficient for rescue of chromosome missegregation in mutants lacking telomere clustering. {\textcopyright} 2014 by Japan Society for Cell Biology.},

Interestingly, in C. elegans embryos, this goes along with temporal regulation: larger cells speed up spindle assembly and elongation. We demonstrate that, similarly in fission yeast, spindle length and spindle dynamics adjust to cell size, which allows to keep mitosis duration constant. Since prolongation of mitosis was shown to affect cell viability, this may resemble a mechanism to regulate mitosis duration. We further reveal how the velocity of spindle elongation is regulated: coupled to cell size, the amount of kinesin-6 Klp9 molecules increases, resulting in an acceleration of spindle elongation in anaphase B. In addition, the number of Klp9 binding sites to microtubules increases overproportionally to Klp9 molecules, suggesting that molecular crowding inversely correlates to cell size and might have an impact on spindle elongation velocity control.},

Telomeres ultimately cluster on the NE, facing the centrosome, in a configuration called the chromosomal bouquet. Here, we discuss novel components and functions of the bouquet microtubule organizing center (MTOC) in meiosis, but also broadly in gamete development. The cellular mechanics of chromosome movements and the bouquet MTOC dynamics are striking. The newly identified zygotene cilium mechanically anchors the bouquet centrosome and completes the bouquet MTOC machinery in zebrafish and mice. We hypothesize that various centrosome anchoring strategies evolved in different species. Evidence suggests that the bouquet MTOC machinery is a cellular organizer, linking meiotic mechanisms with gamete development and morphogenesis. We highlight this cytoskeletal organization as a new platform for creating a holistic understanding of early gametogenesis, with direct implications to fertility and reproduction.},

abstract = {During fertilization the sperm brings two centrosomes into the egg. One centrosome contains a centriole of normal length originally seen as the basal body of the sperm flagellum. Characteristically, the proximal half is enwrapped in osmiophilic material. This centrosome is attached to the centrosomal fossa, a bowl-shaped depression of the nuclear envelope of the male pronucleus. Microtubules radiate out from the osmiophilic half characterizing this structure as a centrosome and microtubule organizing center (MTOC). The second centrosome which also acts as an MTOC is attached to the mitochondrion of the sperm. At the beginning it appears as an unstructured accumulation of osmiophilic material out of which later on centriolar microtubules grow. Though this centrosome is marked by an immature centriole it is capable of organizing microtubules and of reproducing itself. This centrosome becomes loosely associated with the female pronucleus by means of microtubules. Then it separates from the mitochondrion which finally is lost. When the two pronuclei fuse, the centrosome derived from the basal body remains firmly attached to the centrosomal fossa, which has persisted in the envelope of the zygote nucleus after pronuclear fusion. Using the fossa as a marker of the position of this centrosome on the nuclear surface, we conclude that it is a stationary centrosome in the process of bipolarization for the first mitosis.},

abstract = {Meiotic prophase has been studied by both light and electron microscopy in diploid cell lines (h+/h‐) of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. One wild‐type and one mutant strain were used, the latter (mei4‐B2) being blocked after premeiotic DNA synthesis and after commitment to meiosis. Meiosis and sporulation were induced in liquid culture by a shift to a sporulation medium devoid of a nitrogen source. The time course was determined from light‐microscopic preparations; most cells passing through meiotic prophase between 5 and 8 h after the shift. In samples from that interval, ca. 20% of the nuclei were elongate in shape, containing strands of chromatin in rough alignement with the long axis of the nucleus. This stage was found to accumulate in the mutant. A bundle of microtubules, just outside of the spindle plaque, apparently stabilized the elongated shape of the nuclei. Linear electron‐dense structures were observed to populate these nuclei. They resembled unpaired lateral elements of synaptonemal complexes in other organisms. Yet, at no times did we observe a tripartite complex or any other sign of chromosomal pairing in our material. {\textcopyright} 1978 Mendelian Society of Lund},

abstract = {In synchronous cultures of S. cerevisiae undergoing meiosis, an early event in the meiotic recombination pathway, site-specific double strand breaks (DSBs), occurs early in prophase, in some instances well before tripartite synaptonemal complex (SC) begins to form. This observation, together with previous results, supports the view that events involving DSBs are required for SC formation. We discuss the possibility that the mitotic pathway for recombinational repair of DSBs served as the primordial mechanism for connecting homologous chromosomes during the evolution of meiosis. DSBs disappear during the period when tripartite SC structure is forming and elongating (zygotene); presumably, they are converted to another type of recombination intermediate. Neither DSBs nor mature recombinant molecules are present when SCs are full length (pachytene). Mature reciprocally recombinant molecules arise at the end of or just after pachytene. We suggest that the SC might coordinate recombinant maturation with other events of meiosis. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {An important feature of fertilization is the asymmetric inheritance of centrioles. In most species it is the sperm that contributes the initial centriole, which builds the first centrosome that is essential for early development. However, given that centrioles are thought to be exceptionally stable structures, the mechanism behind centriole disappearance in the female germ line remains elusive and paradoxical. We elucidated a program for centriole maintenance in fruit flies, led by Polo kinase and the pericentriolar matrix (PCM): The PCM is downregulated in the female germ line during oogenesis, which results in centriole loss. Perturbing this program prevents centriole loss, leading to abnormal meiotic and mitotic divisions, and thus to female sterility. This mechanism challenges the view that centrioles are intrinsically stable structures and reveals general functions for Polo kinase and the PCM in centriole maintenance. We propose that regulation of this maintenance program is essential for successful sexual reproduction and defines centriole life span in different tissues in homeostasis and disease, thereby shaping the cytoskeleton.},

Less than two decades ago, proteomics and genomic screens conducted in multiple species identified hundreds of centriole and centrosome core proteins and revealed the evolutionarily conserved nature of the centriole assembly pathway. And now, super resolution microscopy approaches and improvements in cryo-tomography are bringing an unparalleled nanoscale-detailed picture of the centriole and centrosome architecture. In this chapter, we summarize the current knowledge about the architecture of human centrioles.

abstract = {The proper partitioning of the genome during meiosis depends on the correct segregation of chromosomes. Errors in this process result in the production of aneuploid gametes, a major cause of birth defects and infertility in humans. In order to segregate properly in meiosis, homologous chromosome partners must attach to microtubules that emanate from opposites poles of the spindle. However, a recent study in yeast has shown that, remarkably, the initial attachments between microtubules and the chromosomes are usually incorrect, which would lead to catastrophic segregation errors, but they are nearly always corrected through the detachment and reattachment of the microtubules. Here we review the reasons for the initial incorrect attachments, which stem from the timing of their formation early in the spindle assembly process, and the fact that the microtubule organizers, called spindle pole bodies in yeast, are not equal. One spindle pole body is older and better able to produce microtubules that attach to the chromosomes. We draw parallels to recent findings in animal cells and suggest that these early microtubule attachments, while often incorrect, may serve an important role in spindle assembly, which, in the long-term, promotes high-fidelity chromosome segregation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Landes Bioscience.},

abstract = {Post-translational modification of proteins by ubiquitylation is increasingly recognised as a highly complex code that contributes to the regulation of diverse cellular processes. In humans, a family of almost 100 deubiquitylase enzymes (DUBs) are assigned to six subfamilies and many of these DUBs can remove ubiquitin from proteins to reverse signals. Roles for individual DUBs have been delineated within specific cellular processes, including many that are dysregulated in diseases, particularly cancer. As potentially druggable enzymes, disease-associated DUBs are of increasing interest as pharmaceutical targets. The biology, structure and regulation of DUBs have been extensively reviewed elsewhere, so here we focus specifically on roles of DUBs in regulating cell cycle processes in mammalian cells. Over a quarter of all DUBs, representing four different families, have been shown to play roles either in the unidirectional progression of the cell cycle through specific checkpoints, or in the DNA damage response and repair pathways. We catalogue these roles and discuss specific examples. Centrosomes are the major microtubule nucleating centres within a cell and play a key role in forming the bipolar mitotic spindle required to accurately divide genetic material between daughter cells during cell division. To enable this mitotic role, centrosomes undergo a complex replication cycle that is intimately linked to the cell division cycle. Here, we also catalogue and discuss DUBs that have been linked to centrosome replication or function, including centrosome clustering, a mitotic survival strategy unique to cancer cells with supernumerary centrosomes.},

We show that the meiosis-specific nuclear-envelope protein KASH5 is a dynein activating adaptor: KASH5 directly binds dynein using a mechanism conserved among activating adaptors and converts dynein into a processive motor. We map the dynein-binding surface of KASH5, identifying mutations that abrogate dynein binding in vitro and disrupt recruitment of the dynein machinery to the nuclear envelope in cultured cells and mouse spermatocytes in vivo.

abstract = {Summary In meiosis, telomeres attach to the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and drive the chromosome movement required for homolog pairing and recombination. Here, we address the question of how telomeres are structurally adapted for the meiotic task. We identify a multi-subunit meiotic telomere-complex, TERB1/2-MAJIN, which takes over telomeric DNA from the shelterin complex in mouse germ cells. TERB1/2-MAJIN initially assembles on the INM sequestered by its putative transmembrane subunit MAJIN. In early meiosis, telomere attachment is achieved by the formation of a chimeric complex of TERB1/2-MAJIN and shelterin. The chimeric complex matures during prophase into DNA-bound TERB1/2-MAJIN by releasing shelterin, forming a direct link between telomeric DNA and the INM. These hierarchical processes, termed "telomere cap exchange," are regulated by CDK-dependent phosphorylation and the DNA-binding activity of MAJIN. Further, we uncover a positive feedback between telomere attachment and chromosome movement, revealing a comprehensive regulatory network underlying meiosis-specific telomere function in mammals.},

abstract = {Microtubule dynamics have key roles in mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome movement [1]. Fast turnover of spindle microtubules at metaphase and polewards flux of microtubules (polewards movement of the microtubule lattice with depolymerization at the poles) at both metaphase and anaphase have been observed in mammalian cells [2]. Imaging spindle dynamics in genetically tractable yeasts is now possible using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagging of tubulin and sites on chromosomes [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]. We used photobleaching of GFP-labeled tubulin to observe microtubule dynamics in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Photobleaching did not perturb progress through mitosis. Bleached marks made on the spindle during metaphase recovered their fluorescence rapidly, indicating fast microtubule turnover. Recovery was spatially non-uniform, but we found no evidence for polewards flux. Marks made during anaphase B did not recover fluorescence, and were observed to slide away from each other at the same rate as spindle elongation. Fast microtubule turnover at metaphase and a switch to stable microtubules at anaphase suggest the existence of a cell-cycle-regulated molecular switch that controls microtubule dynamics and that may be conserved in evolution. Unlike the situation for vertebrate spindles, microtubule depolymerization at poles and polewards flux may not occur in S. pombe mitosis. We conclude that GFP-tubulin photobleaching in conjunction with mutant cells should aid research on molecular mechanisms causing and regulating dynamics.},

abstract = {The synaptonemal complex (SC) links two meiotic prophase chromosomal events: homolog pairing and crossover recombination. SC formation involves the multimeric assembly of coiled-coil proteins (Zip1 in budding yeast) at the interface of aligned homologous chromosomes. However, SC assembly is indifferent to homology and thus is normally regulated such that it occurs only subsequent to homology recognition. Assembled SC structurally interfaces with and influences the level and distribution of interhomolog crossover recombination events. Despite its involvement in dynamic chromosome behaviors such as homolog pairing and recombination, the extent to which SC, once installed, acts as an irreversible tether or maintains the capacity to remodel is not clear. Experiments presented here reveal insight into the dynamics of the full-length SC in budding yeast meiotic cells. We demonstrate that Zip1 continually incorporates into previously assembled synaptonemal complex during meiotic prophase. Moreover, post-synapsis Zip1 incorporation is sufficient to rescue the sporulation defect triggered by SCs built with a mutant version of Zip1, Zip1-4LA. Post-synapsis Zip1 incorporation occurs initially with a non-uniform spatial distribution, predominantly associated with Zip3, a component of the synapsis initiation complex that is presumed to mark a subset of crossover sites. A non-uniform dynamic architecture of the SC is observed independently of (i) synapsis initiation components, (ii) the Pch2 and Pph3 proteins that have been linked to Zip1 regulation, and (iii) the presence of a homolog. Finally, the rate of SC assembly and SC central region size increase in proportion to Zip1 copy number; this and other observations suggest that Zip1 does not exit the SC structure to the same extent that it enters. Our observations suggest that, after full-length assembly, SC central region exhibits little global turnover but maintains differential assembly dynamics at sites whose distribution is patterned by a recombination landscape. {\textcopyright} 2012 Voelkel-Meiman et al.},

abstract = {During the transition from mitosis to meiosis, the kinetochore undergoes significant reorganization, switching from a bipolar to a monopolar orientation. To examine the centromere proteins that are involved in fundamental reorganization in meiosis, we observed the localization of 22 mitotic and 2 meiotic protein components of the kinetochore during meiosis in living cells of the fission yeast. We found that the 22 mitotic proteins can be classified into three groups: the Mis6-like group, the NMS (Ndc80-Mis12-Spc7) group, and the DASH group, based on their meiotic behavior. Mis6-like group proteins remain at the centromere throughout meiosis. NMS group proteins disappear from the centromere at the onset of meiosis and reappear at the centromere in two steps in late prophase. DASH group proteins appear shortly before metaphase of meiosis I. These observations suggest that Mis6-like group proteins constitute the structural basis of the centromere and that the NMS and DASH group proteins reassemble to establish the functional metaphase kinetochore. On the other hand, the meiosis-specific protein Moa1, which plays an important role in forming the meiotic monopolar kinetochore, is loaded onto the centromere significantly earlier than the NMS group, whereas another meiosis-specific protein, Sgo1, is loaded at times similar to the NMS group.},

While much is known about the structures that promote acentrosomal microtubule nucleation, less is known about the structures that mediate spindle bipolarization in mammalian oocytes. Here, we show that in mouse oocytes, kinetochores are required for spindle bipolarization in meiosis I. This process is promoted by oocyte-specific, microtubule-independent enrichment of the antiparallel microtubule crosslinker Prc1 at kinetochores via the Ndc80 complex. In contrast, in meiosis II, cytoplasm that contains upregulated factors including Prc1 supports kinetochore-independent pathways for spindle bipolarization. The kinetochore-dependent mode of spindle bipolarization is required for meiosis I to prevent chromosome segregation errors. Human oocytes, where spindle bipolarization is reportedly error prone, exhibit no detectable kinetochore enrichment of Prc1. This study reveals an oocyte-specific function of kinetochores in acentrosomal spindle bipolarization in mice, and provides insights into the error-prone nature of human oocytes.},

abstract = {Chromosomes are segregated by two antiparallel arrays of microtubules arranged to form the spindle apparatus. During cell division, the nucleation of cytosolic microtubules is prevented and spindle microtubules nucleate from centrosomes (in mitotic animal cells) or around chromosomes (in plants and some meiotic cells). The molecular mechanism by which chromosomes induce local microtubule nucleation in the absence of centrosomes is unknown, but it can be studied by adding chromatin beads to Xenopus egg extracts. The beads nucleate microtubules that eventually reorganize into a bipolar spindle. RCC1, the guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor for the GTPase protein Ran, is a component of chromatin. Using the chromatin bead assay, we show here that the activity of chromosome-associated RCC1 protein is required for spindle formation. Ran itself, when in the GTP-bound state (Ran-GTP), induces microtubule nucleation and spindle-like structures in M-phase extract. We propose that RCC1 generates a high local concentration of Ran-GTP around chromatin which in turn induces the local nucleation of microtubules.},

abstract = {Chromosome segregation in mammalian oocytes is driven by a microtubule spindle lacking centrosomes. Here, we analyze centrosome-independent spindle assembly by quantitative high-resolution confocal imaging in live maturing mouse oocytes. We show that spindle assembly proceeds by the self-organization of over 80 microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) that form de novo from a cytoplasmic microtubule network in prophase and that functionally replace centrosomes. Initially distributed throughout the ooplasm, MTOCs congress at the center of the oocyte, where they contribute to a massive, Ran-dependent increase of the number of microtubules after nuclear envelope breakdown and to the individualization of clustered chromosomes. Through progressive MTOC clustering and activation of kinesin-5, the multipolar MTOC aggregate self-organizes into a bipolar intermediate, which then elongates and thereby establishes chromosome biorientation. Finally, a stable barrel-shaped acentrosomal metaphase spindle with oscillating chromosomes and astral-like microtubules forms that surprisingly exhibits key properties of a centrosomal spindle. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Requires1990,
abstract = {Xenopus eggs are laid arrested at second metaphase of meiosis lacking a functional centrosome. Upon fertilization, the sperm provides the active centrosome that is required for cleavage to occur. The injection of purified centrosomes mimics fertilization and leads to tadpole formation (parthenogenesis). In this work we show that the parthenogenetic activity of centrosomes is inactivated by urea concentrations higher than 2 M. The loss of activity is correlated with a progressive destruction of the centriolar cylinder and extraction of proteins. This shows that centrosomes are relatively sensitive to urea since complete protein unfolding and solubilization of proteins normally occurs at urea concentrations as high as 8-10 M. When present, the parthenogenetic activity is always associated with a pelletable fraction showing that it cannot be solubilized by urea. The parthenogenetic activity is progressively inactivated by salt concentrations higher than 2 M (NaCl or KCl). However, only a few proteins are extracted by these treatments and the centrosome ultrastructure is not affected. This shows that both parthenogenetic activity and centrosomal structure are resistant to relatively high ionic strength. Indeed, most protein structures held by electrostatic forces are dissociated by 2 M salt. The loss of parthenogenetic activity produced at higher salt concentrations, while the structure of the centrosome is unaffected, is an apparent paradox. We interpret this result as meaning that the native state of centrosomes is held together by forces that favor functional denaturation by high ionic strength. The respective effects of urea and salts on centrosomal structure and activity suggest that the centrosome is mainly held together by hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds. The in vitro microtubule nucleating activity of centrosomes can be inactivated at salt or urea concentrations that do not affect the parthenogenetic activity. Since egg cleavage requires the formation of microtubule asters, we conclude that the extracted or denatured microtubule nucleating activity of centrosomes can be complemented by components present in the egg cytoplasm. Both parthenogenetic and microtubule nucleating activities are abolished by protease treatments but resist nuclease action. Since we find no RNA in centrosomes treated by RNase, they probably do not contain a protected RNA. Taken together, these results are consistent with the idea that the whole or part of the centrosome structure acts as a seed to start the centrosome duplication cycle in Xenopus eggs.},

abstract = {During meiotic prophase, chromosome arrangement and oscillation promote the pairing of homologous chromosomes for meiotic recombination. This dramatic movement involves clustering of telomeres at the nuclear membrane to form the so-called telomere bouquet. In fission yeast, the telomere bouquet is formed near the spindle pole body (SPB), which is the microtubule organising centre, functionally equivalent to the metazoan centrosome. Disruption of bouquet configuration impedes homologous chromosome pairing, meiotic recombination and spindle formation. Here, we demonstrate that the bouquet is maintained throughout meiotic prophase and promotes timely prophase exit in fission yeast. Persistent DNA damages, induced during meiotic recombination, activate the Rad3 and Chk1 DNA damage checkpoint kinases and extend the bouquet stage beyond the chromosome oscillation period. The auxin-inducible degron system demonstrated that premature termination of the bouquet stage leads to severe extension of prophase and consequently spindle formation defects. However, this delayed exit from meiotic prophase was not caused by residual DNA damage. Rather, loss of chromosome contact with the SPB caused delayed accumulation of CDK1-cyclin B at the SPB, which correlated with impaired SPB separation. In the absence of the bouquet, CDK1-cyclin B localised near the telomeres but not at the SPB at the later stage of meiotic prophase. Thus, bouquet configuration is maintained throughout meiotic prophase, by which this spatial organisation may facilitate local and timely activation of CDK1 near the SPB. Our findings illustrate that chromosome contact with the nuclear membrane synchronises meiotic progression of the nucleoplasmic chromosomes with that of the cytoplasmic SPB.},

abstract = {The organization of microtubule networks is crucial for controlling chromosome segregation during cell division, for positioning and transport of different organelles, and for cell polarity and morphogenesis. The geometry of microtubule arrays strongly depends on the localization and activity of the sites where microtubules are nucleated and where their minus ends are anchored. Such sites are often clustered into structures known as microtubule-organizing centers, which include the centrosomes in animals and spindle pole bodies in fungi. In addition, other microtubules, as well as membrane compartments such as the cell nucleus, the Golgi apparatus, and the cell cortex, can nucleate, stabilize, and tether microtubule minus ends. These activities depend on microtubule-nucleating factors, such as $\gamma$-tubulin-containing complexes and their activators and receptors, and microtubule minus end–stabilizing proteins with their binding partners. Here, we provide an overview of the current knowledge on how such factors work together to control microtubule organization in different systems.},

In this publication, we extend the fission yeast clade gene nomenclature guidelines to support the curation efforts at PomBase (www.pombase.org), the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Model Organism Database. This update introduces nomenclature guidelines for noncoding RNA genes, following those set forth by the Human Genome Organisation Gene Nomenclature Committee. Additionally, we provide a significant update to the allele and genotype nomenclature guidelines originally published in 1987, to standardize the diverse range of genetic modifications enabled by the fission yeast genetic toolbox. These updated guidelines reflect a community consensus between numerous fission yeast researchers. Adoption of these rules will improve consistency in gene and genotype nomenclature, and facilitate machine-readability and automated entity recognition of fission yeast genes and alleles in publications or datasets. In conclusion, our updated guidelines provide a valuable resource for the fission yeast research community, promoting consistency, clarity, and FAIRness in genetic data sharing and interpretation.},

abstract = {Establishment of proper chromosome attachments to the spindle requires elimination of erroneous attachments, but the mechanism of this process is not fully understood. During meiosis I, sister chromatids attach to the same spindle pole (mono-oriented attachment), whereas homologous chromosomes attach to opposite poles (bi-oriented attachment), resulting in homologous chromosome segregation. Here, we show that chiasmata that link homologous chromosomes and kinetochore component Dam1 are crucial for elimination of erroneous attachments and oscillation of centromeres between the spindle poles at meiosis I in fission yeast. In chiasma-forming cells, Mad2 and Aurora B kinase, which provides time for attachment correction and destabilizes erroneous attachments, respectively, caused elimination of bi-oriented attachments of sister chromatids, whereas in chiasma-lacking cells, they caused elimination of mono-oriented attachments. In chiasma-forming cells, in addition, homologous centromere oscillation was coordinated. Furthermore, Dam1 contributed to attachment elimination in both chiasma-forming and chiasma-lacking cells, and drove centromere oscillation. These results demonstrate that chiasmata alter attachment correction patterns by enabling error correction factors to eliminate bi-oriented attachment of sister chromatids, and suggest that Dam1 induces elimination of erroneous attachments. The coincidental contribution of chiasmata and Dam1 to centromere oscillation also suggests a potential link between centromere oscillation and attachment elimination.},

abstract = {Conditional degron technologies, which allow a protein of interest to be degraded in an inducible manner, are important tools for biological research, and are especially useful for creating conditional loss-of-function mutants of essential genes. The auxin-inducible degron (AID) technology, which utilizes plant auxin signaling components to control protein degradation in nonplant species, is a widely used small-molecular-controlled degradation method in yeasts and animals. However, the currently available AID systems still have room for further optimization. Here, we have improved the AID system for the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe by optimizing all three components: the AID degron, the small-molecule inducer, and the inducer-responsive F-box protein. We chose a 36-amino-acid sequence of the Arabidopsis IAA17 protein as the degron and employed three tandem copies of it to enhance efficiency. To minimize undesirable side effects of the inducer, we adopted a bulky analog of auxin, 5-adamantyl-IAA, and paired it with the F-box protein OsTIR1 that harbors a mutation (F74A) at the auxin-binding pocket. 5-adamantyl-IAA, when utilized with OsTIR1-F74A, is effective at concentrations thousands of times lower than auxin used in combination with wild-type OsTIR1. We tested our improved AID system on 10 essential genes and achieved inducible lethality for all of them, including ones that could not be effectively inactivated using a previously published AID system. Our improved AID system should facilitate the construction of conditional loss-of-function mutants in fission yeast.},

In mammals, the mechanical properties of chromosome movement and the cytoskeletal structures responsible for it remain poorly understood. Here, applying an in vivo electroporation (EP) technique in live mouse testis, we achieved the quick visualization of telomere, chromosome axis and microtubule organizing center (MTOC) movements. For the first time, we defined prophase sub-stages of live spermatocytes morphologically according to GFP-TRF1 and GFP-SCP3 signals. We show that rapid telomere movement and subsequent nuclear rotation persist from leptotene/zygotene to pachytene, and then decline in diplotene stage concomitant with the liberation of SUN1 from telomeres. Further, during bouquet stage, telomeres are constrained near the MTOC, resulting in the transient suppression of telomere mobility and nuclear rotation. MTs are responsible for these movements by forming cable-like structures on the NE, and, probably, by facilitating the rail-tacking movements of telomeres on the MT cables. In contrast, actin regulates the oscillatory changes in nuclear shape. Our data provide the mechanical scheme for meiotic chromosome movement throughout prophase I in mammals.},

To cross two strains, a loopful of h– and a loopful of h+ are mixed together on a ME plate. The cross is left to dry and is then incubated below 30°, as conjugation is severely reduced above this temperature. Fully formed four-spore asci can be seen after 2–3 days of incubation. A 2 day-old cross is usually used for tetrad analysis. Using a 3-day-old cross, one can check for the presence of asci under the light microscope. Random spore analysis allows many more spores to be examined than in tetrad analysis, and in this way recombination mapping and strain construction can be carried out. Diploid cells arise spontaneously in most S. pombe strains, this characteristic can be used to isolate homozygous diploids of any strain.

abstract = {During meiotic prophase, telomere-mediated chromosomal movement along the nuclear envelope is crucial for homologue pairing and synapsis. However, how telomeres are modified to mediate chromosome movement is largely elusive. Here we show that mammalian meiotic telomeres are fundamentally modified by a meiosis-specific Myb-domain protein, TERB1, that localizes at telomeres in mouse germ cells. TERB1 forms a heterocomplex with the canonical telomeric protein TRF1 and binds telomere repeat DNA. Disruption of Terb1 in mice abolishes meiotic chromosomal movement and impairs homologous pairing and synapsis, causing infertility in both sexes. TERB1 promotes telomere association with the nuclear envelope and deposition of the SUN-KASH complex, which recruits cytoplasmic motor complexes. TERB1 also binds and recruits cohesin to telomeres to develop structural rigidity, strikingly reminiscent of centromeres. Our study suggests that TERB1 acts as a central hub for the assembly of a conserved meiotic telomere complex required for chromosome movements. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans syp-1 mutants reveals that both synapsis-dependent and -independent mechanisms contribute to stable, productive alignment of homologous chromosomes during meiotic prophase. Early prophase nuclei undergo normal reorganization in syp-1 mutants, and chromosomes initially pair. However, the polarized nuclear organization characteristic of early prophase persists for a prolonged period, and homologs dissociate prematurely; furthermore, the synaptonemal complex (SC) is absent. The predicted structure of SYP-1, its localization at the interface between intimately paired, lengthwise-aligned pachytene homologs, and its kinetics of localization with chromosomes indicate that SYP-1 is an SC structural component. A severe reduction in crossing over together with evidence for accumulated recombination intermediates in syp-1 mutants indicate that initial pairing is not sufficient for completion of exchange and implicates the SC in promoting crossover recombination. Persistence of polarized nuclear organization in syp-1 mutants suggests that SC polymerization may provide a motive force or signal that drives redispersal of chromosomes. Whereas our analysis suggests that the SC is required to stabilize pairing along the entire lengths of chromosomes, striking differences in peak pairing levels for opposite ends of chromosomes in syp-1 mutants reveal the existence of an additional mechanism that can promote local stabilization of pairing, independent of synapsis.},

abstract = {The segregation of achiasmate chromosome pairs at meiosis I is not brought about by a single 'distributive system' as previously thought, but rather by two separate mechanisms. One system uses the pairing of proximal heterochromatic sequences to mediate the segregation of achiasmate homologs - an observation that, at long last, defines a function for heterochromatin. The other system facilitates the segregation of heterologous chromosomes, by an as yet undiscovered mechanism. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Fast growth of microtubules is essential for rapid assembly of the microtubule cytoskeleton during cell proliferation and differentiation. XMAP215 belongs to a conserved family of proteins that promote microtubule growth. To determine how XMAP215 accelerates growth, we developed a single-molecule assay to visualize directly XMAP215-GFP interacting with dynamic microtubules. XMAP215 binds free tubulin in a 1:1 complex that interacts with the microtubule lattice and targets the ends by a diffusion-facilitated mechanism. XMAP215 persists at the plus end for many rounds of tubulin subunit addition in a form of "tip tracking." These results show that XMAP215 is a processive polymerase that directly catalyzes the addition of up to 25 tubulin dimers to the growing plus end. Under some circumstances XMAP215 can also catalyze the reverse reaction, namely microtubule shrinkage. The similarities between XMAP215 and formins, actin polymerases, suggest that processive tip tracking is a common mechanism for stimulating the growth of cytoskeletal polymers. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Microtubule (MT) nucleation not only occurs from centrosomes, but also in large part from dispersed nucleation sites. The subsequent sorting of short MTs into networks like the mitotic spindle requires molecular motors that laterally slide overlapping MTs and bundling proteins that statically connect MTs. How bundling proteins interfere with MT sliding is unclear. In bipolar MT bundles in fission yeast, we found that the bundler ase1p localized all along the length of antiparallel MTs, whereas the motor klp2p (kinesin-14) accumulated only at MT plus ends. Consequently, sliding forces could only overcome resistant bundling forces for short, newly nucleated MTs, which were transported to their correct position within bundles. Ase1p thus regulated sliding forces based on polarity and overlap length, and computer simulations showed these mechanisms to be sufficient to generate stable bipolar bundles. By combining motor and bundling proteins, cells can thus dynamically organize stable regions of overlap between cytoskeletal filaments. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Proper microtubule organization is essential for cellular processes such as organelle positioning during interphase and spindle formation during mitosis. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe presents a good model for understanding microtubule organization. We identify fission yeast ase1p, a member of the conserved ASE1/PRC1/MAP65 family of microtubule bundling proteins, which functions in organizing the spindle midzone during mitosis. Using fluorescence live cell imaging, we show that ase1p localizes to sites of microtubule overlaps associated with microtubule organizing centers at both interphase and mitosis. ase1$\Delta$ mutants fail to form overlapping antiparallel microtubule bundles, leading to interphase nuclear positioning defects, and premature mitotic spindle collapse. FRAP analysis revealed that interphase ase1p at overlapping microtubule minus ends is highly dynamic. In contrast, mitotic ase1p at microtubule plus ends at the spindle midzone is more stable. We propose that ase1p functions to organize microtubules into overlapping antiparallel bundles both in interphase and mitosis and that ase1p may be differentially regulated through the cell cycle.},
