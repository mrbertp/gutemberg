## h90 haploids

1. Thaw cells in YES plates and incubate for 1-2 days at 25-32ºC.

2. Grow a culture in liquid YES at 25-30ºC with 200 rpm agitation up to saturation.

3. Subculture in liquid MM 1% Glu + Sup to reach O.D. 0.8-1 with 200 rpm agitation.

> For the generation time, you can estimate:

|Genotype                         |T (ºC)|Gen. time (h)|
|:--------------------------------|-----:|------------:|
|wt                               |25ºC  |6.5          |
|wt                               |28ºC  |4.5          |
|bqt1$\Delta$ sad1.2              |25ºC  |7            |
|imp1$\Delta$ bqt1$\Delta$ sad1.2 |25ºC  |9.5          |

4. Centrifuge for 3 min at 3000 rpm.

5. Discar supernatant by pouring and wash pellet with equal volume of MM - N.

6. Centrifuge for 3 min at 3000 rpm.

7. Remove supernatant completely by pipetting.

8. Resuspend pellet in 100-200 uL MM - N (depending on pellet size).

9. Plate a drop of 20 uL of suspension in a MEA plate (tempered at room temperature) and incubate for 4-5 h at 28ºC.
